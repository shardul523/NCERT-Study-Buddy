Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSome towns like Ahmedabad (Gujarat) went on to become major commercial cities but others like Thanjavur shrank in size and importance over the centuries. Murshidabad (West Bengal) on the banks of the Bhagirathi, which rose to prominence as a centre for silks and became the capital of Bengal in 1704, declined in the course of the century as the weavers faced competition from cheap mill-made cloth from England. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts, crafts and production activities flourished in towns and villages. Over the centuries important political, social and economic developments had taken place. But social change was not the same everywhere, because different kinds of societies evolved differently. It is important to understand how, and why, this happened. \nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms. The difference between the high and low, and between the rich and poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWhile many people lived in the cities, others living in the countryside grew crops and reared animals. These farmers and herders supplied food to crafts persons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We know from remains of plants that the Harappans grew wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed and mustard. \nA new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds. While real ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have not survived, toy models have been found. As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used. This means that water was stored and supplied to the fields when the plants were growing. \nThe Harappans reared cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available around settlements. However, in the dry summer months large herds of animals were probably taken to greater distances in search of grass and water. They also collected fruits like ber, caught fish and hunted wild animals like the antelope. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe rich, glossy colours of silk, as well as its smooth texture, make it a highly valued fabric in most societies. Making silk is a complicated process. Raw silk has to be extracted from the cocoons of silk worms, spun into thread and then woven into cloth. Techniques of making silk were first invented in China around 7000 years ago. While the methods remained a closely guarded secret for thousands of years, some people from China who went to distant lands on foot, horseback, and on camels, carried silk with them. The paths they followed came to be known as the Silk Route. \nSometimes, Chinese rulers sent gifts of silk to rulers in Iran and west Asia, and from there, the knowledge of silk spread further west. About 2000 years ago, wearing silk became the fashion amongst rulers and rich people in Rome. It was very expensive, as it had to be brought all the way from China, along dangerous roads, through mountains and deserts. People living along the route often demanded payments for allowing traders to pass through. \nLook at Map 6 (pages 84-85) which shows the Silk Route and its branches. Some kings tried to control large portions of the route. This was because they could benefit from taxes, tributes and gifts that were brought by traders travelling along the route. In return, they often protected the traders who passed through their kingdoms from attacks by robbers. \nThe best-known of the rulers who controlled the Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over central Asia and north-west India around 2000 years ago. Their two major centres of power were Peshawar and Mathura. Taxila was also included in their kingdom. During their rule, a branch of the Silk Route extended from Central Asia down to the seaports at the mouth of the river Indus, from where silk was shipped westwards to the Roman Empire. The Kushanas were amongst the earliest rulers of the subcontinent to issue gold coins. These were used by traders along the Silk Route. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What evidence is provided for early textile production in the Harappan civilization, and how does the later discussion of silk illustrate the complexities of textile trade, economic value, and the impact of competition on production centers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Early Textile Production (Harappan):** The text states that 'Cotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago.' Further evidence includes 'Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro,' and the discovery of 'spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience,' which 'were used to spin thread.' This collectively points to early textile manufacturing in the Harappan period. \n2.  **Silk Trade and Economic Value:** The text explains that 'Techniques of making silk were first invented in China around 7000 years ago' and that silk became 'a highly valued fabric in most societies' due to its qualities. Its trade led to the 'Silk Route,' where 'kings tried to control large portions of the route' to 'benefit from taxes, tributes and gifts.' The Kushanas, prominent rulers of the Silk Route, 'were amongst the earliest rulers of the subcontinent to issue gold coins,' which were 'used by traders along the Silk Route,' signifying the high economic value and organized trade. \n3.  **Impact of Competition and Decline:** The text illustrates the negative impact of competition with the example of 'Murshidabad (West Bengal),' a significant 'centre for silks.' This city 'declined in the course of the century as the weavers faced competition from cheap mill-made cloth from England,' demonstrating how external economic factors could lead to the decline of established textile production hubs.\n\nAnswer: The Harappan civilization shows evidence of early textile production, with cotton grown at Mehrgarh around 7000 years ago, actual pieces of cloth found at Mohenjodaro, and spindle whorls used for spinning thread. Later, silk illustrates complex textile trade dynamics: invented in China, it became a highly valued fabric traded along the Silk Route, where rulers like the Kushanas benefited from taxes and issued gold coins for trade. However, the impact of competition is shown by the decline of silk production centers like Murshidabad, which suffered due to cheap mill-made cloth from England."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.1", "6.4.5", "7.6.7", "6.10.3", "6.4.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWorking Towards Change \n\n From the early nineteenth century, we find debates and discussions about social customs and practices taking on a new character. One important reason for this was the development of new forms of communication. For the first time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and pamphlets were printed. These were far cheaper and far more accessible than the manuscripts that you have read about in Class VII. Therefore ordinary people could read these, and many of them could also write and express their ideas in their own languages. All kinds of issues \u2013 social, political, economic and religious \u2013 could now be debated and discussed by men (and sometimes by women as well) in the new cities. The discussions could reach out to a wider public, and could become linked to movements for social change. \nThese debates were often initiated by Indian reformers and reform groups. One such reformer was Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833). He founded a reform association known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known as the Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. People such as Rammohun Roy are described as reformers because they felt that changes were necessary in society, and unjust practices needed to be done away with. They thought that the best way to ensure such changes was by persuading people to give up old practices and adopt a new way of life. \nRammohun Roy was keen to spread the knowledge of Western education in the country and bring about greater freedom and equality for women. He wrote about the way women were forced to bear the burden of domestic work, confined to the home and the kitchen, and not allowed to move out and become educated. \nChanging the lives of widows \n Rammohun Roy was particularly moved by the problems widows faced in their lives. He began a campaign against the practice of sati. Rammohun Roy was well versed in Sanskrit, Persian and several other Indian and Europeon languages. He tried to show through his writings that the practice of widow burning had no sanction in ancient texts. By the early nineteenth century, many British officials had also begun to criticise Indian traditions and customs. They were therefore more than willing to listen to Rammohun who was reputed to be a learned man. In 1829, sati was banned. \nThe strategy adopted by Rammohun was used by later reformers as well. Whenever they wished to challenge a practice that seemed harmful, they tried to find a verse or sentence in the ancient sacred texts that supported their point of view. They then suggested that the practice as it existed at present was against early tradition. \nFor instance, one of the most famous reformers, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, used the ancient texts to suggest that widows could remarry. His suggestion was adopted by British officials, and a law was passed in 1856 permitting widow remarriage. Those who were against the remarriage of widows opposed Vidyasagar, and even boycotted him. \nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, the movement in favour of widow remarriage spread to other parts of the country. In the Telugu-speaking areas of the Madras Presidency, Veerasalingam Pantulu formed an association for widow remarriage. Around the same time young intellectuals and reformers in Bombay pledged themselves to working for the same cause. In the north, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who founded the reform association called Arya Samaj, also supported widow remarriage. Yet, the number of widows who actually remarried remained low. Those who married were not easily accepted in society and conservative groups continued to oppose the new law. \nGirls begin going to school \n Many of the reformers felt that education for girls was necessary in order to improve the condition of women. Vidyasagar in Calcutta and many other reformers in Bombay set up schools for girls. When the first schools were opened in the mid-nineteenth century, many people were afraid of them. They feared that schools would take girls away from home, prevent them from doing their domestic duties. Moreover, girls had to travel through public places in order to reach school. Many people felt that this would have a corrupting influence on them. They felt that girls should stay away from public spaces. Therefore, throughout the nineteenth century, most educated women were taught at home by liberal fathers or husbands. Sometimes women taught themselves. Do you remember what you read about Rashsundari Debi in your book Social and Political Life last year? She was one of those who secretly learned to read and write in the flickering light of candles at night. \nIn the latter part of the century, schools for girls were established by the Arya Samaj in Punjab, and Jyotirao Phule in Maharashtra. In aristocratic Muslim households in North India, women learnt to read the Koran in Arabic. They were taught by women who came home to teach. Some reformers such as Mumtaz Ali reinterpreted verses from the Koran to argue for women\u2019s education. The first Urdu novels began to be written from the late nineteenth century. Amongst other things, these were meant to encourage women to read about religion and domestic management in a language they could understand. \nWomen write about women From the early twentieth century, Muslim women like the Begums of Bhopal played a notable role in promoting education among women. They founded a primary school for girls at Aligarh. Another remarkable woman, Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain started schools for Muslim girls in Patna and Calcutta. She was a fearless critic of conservative ideas, arguing that religious leaders of every faith accorded an inferior place to women. \nBy the 1880s, Indian women began to enter universities. Some of them trained to be doctors, some became teachers. Many women began to write and publish their critical views on the place of women in society. Tarabai Shinde, a woman educated at home at Poona, published a book, Stripurushtulna, (A Comparison between Women and Men), criticising the social differences between men and women. \nPandita Ramabai, a great scholar of Sanskrit, felt that Hinduism was oppressive towards women, and wrote a book about the miserable lives of upper-caste Hindu women. She founded a widows\u2019 home at Poona to provide shelter to widows who had been treated badly by their husbands\u2019 relatives. Here women were trained so that they could support themselves economically. \nNeedless to say, all this more than alarmed the orthodox. For instance, many Hindu nationalists felt that Hindu women were adopting Western ways and that this would corrupt Hindu culture and erode family values. Orthodox Muslims were also worried about the impact of these changes. \nAs you can see, by the end of the nineteenth century, women themselves were actively working for reform. They wrote books, edited magazines, founded schools and training centres, and set up women\u2019s associations. From the early twentieth century, they formed political pressure groups to push through laws for female suffrage (the right to vote) and better health care and education for women. Some of them joined various kinds of nationalist and socialist movements from the 1920s. \nIn the twentieth century, leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose lent their support to demands for greater equality and freedom for women. Nationalist leaders promised that there would be full suffrage for all men and women after Independence. However, till then they asked women to concentrate on the anti-British struggles. \nLaw against child marriage \n With the growth of women\u2019s organisations and writings on these issues, the momentum for reform gained strength. People challenged another established custom \u2013 that of child marriage. There were a number of Indian legislators in the Central Legislative Assembly who fought to make a law preventing child marriage. In 1929 the Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed without the kind of bitter debates and struggles that earlier laws had seen. According to the Act no man below the age of 18 and woman below the age of 16 could marry. Subsequently these limits were raised to 21 for men and 18 for women. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe kings and kingdoms you have been reading about could not have existed without the support of flourishing villages. While new tools and the system of transplantation (Chapter 6) increased production, irrigation was also used. Irrigation works that were built during this time included canals, wells, tanks, and artificial lakes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did the East India Company evolve from a purely mercantile trading company into a significant administrative power in India, and what methods did the British administration use to document such historical developments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text in the 'East India Company Comes East' section establishes the Company's initial mercantile nature, stating it acquired a charter in 1600 from Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the 'sole right to trade with the East' to 'buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices.'\n2. The text explains that competition with other European powers for Indian goods 'inevitably pushed up the prices,' reducing profits. This led the Company to 'eliminat[e] rival competitors' through 'fierce battles,' sinking ships, blockading routes, and fortifying trading posts, blurring the lines between trade and politics.\n3. In Bengal, the Company's first factory was set up in 1651. It began building a fort by 1698 and 'bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages.' It also 'persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free,' demonstrating its acquisition of administrative and political influence.\n4. The 'How trade led to battles' and 'The Battle of Plassey' sections detail escalating conflicts with the Nawabs of Bengal, who resisted the Company's demands and refusal to pay duties. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, facilitated by Mir Jafar's betrayal, marked the Company's 'first major victory' and allowed it to install puppet rulers, solidifying its military and political control.\n5. The text further states that the difficulties with 'puppet nawabs' led to their deposition. Ultimately, in 1765, the Mughal emperor 'appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal,' granting it 'vast revenue resources.' This allowed revenues to 'finance Company expenses,' 'maintain Company troops,' and 'meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices,' signifying its full administrative and financial control.\n6. For documentation, the 'How do We Know?' section states that the British believed 'the act of writing was important' and 'Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up,' creating an 'administrative culture of memos, notings and reports.'\n7. It specifies that 'record rooms attached to all administrative institutions' and 'Specialised institutions like archives and museums' were established for preservation. Documents were 'carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists' in the early 19th century and later 'printed' by the mid-19th century.\n8. Additionally, 'Surveys became important' for effective administration. This included 'detailed surveys... to map the entire country,' 'revenue surveys,' and 'Census operations... every ten years,' which recorded information on 'castes, religions and occupation,' along with other specialized surveys.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company evolved from a mercantile trading company, initially focused on buying and selling goods for profit, into a significant administrative power through a series of strategic political and military actions. Driven by competition, it began fortifying settlements and engaging in conflicts, eventually acquiring zamindari rights, securing duty-free trade, and winning the Battle of Plassey. This culminated in the Mughal emperor appointing the Company as the Diwan of Bengal in 1765, granting it control over vast revenue resources and solidifying its administrative authority. The British administration documented these historical developments through a meticulous system of written official records, including instructions, plans, policies, memos, and reports, which were preserved in record rooms, archives, and museums. These documents were initially copied by calligraphists and later printed. Furthermore, extensive surveys, such as revenue surveys and decennial Census operations, were conducted to gather detailed information about the country for effective governance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.6.2", "8.8.2", "6.9.2", "8.2.2", "8.1.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As they moved eastwards, they cleared forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new communities of peasants. \nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries received land and often set up mosques that served as centres for religious transformation in these areas. \nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. These were provided by community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People referred to them with affection and respect as pirs. \nPir : A Persian word meaning a spiritual guide. \nThis term included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal. \nAnimism : Attribution of living soul to plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena. \nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapters 2 and 5) that temples and other religious structures were often built by individuals or groups who were becoming powerful \u2013 to both demonstrate their power and proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several \u201clow\u201d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). The coming of the European trading companies created new economic opportunities; many families belonging to these social groups availed of these. As their social and economic position improved, they proclaimed their status through the construction of temples. When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts. (Remember the \u201cBangla dome\u201d in Chapter 5?) This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in temple architecture. \nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. Temples were usually built on a square platform. The interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, such decorations reached a high degree of excellence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nNorthern Black Polished Ware (NBPW) NBPW is a hard, wheel made, metallic looking ware with a shiny black sur face.

For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons. The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThis was also the time when other scholars were at work.

Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere were two major changes in agriculture around this time. One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the significant social transformations and scientific advancements described in the provided texts regarding ancient India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The social transformations are detailed in the first section.

At the same time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj. Because there were three \u201cparties\u201d in this longdrawn conflict, historians often describe it as the \u201ctripartite struggle\u201d. \nAs we will see (pp. 62-66), rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples. So, when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms, they often chose to target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich. You will read more about this in Chapter 5. \nOne of the best known of such rulers is Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. He ruled from 997 to 1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia, Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent. He raided the subcontinent almost every year \u2013 his targets were wealthy temples, including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni. \nSultan Mahmud was also interested in finding out more about the people he conquered, and entrusted a scholar named Al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent. This Arabic work, known as the Kitab ul-Hind, remains an important source for historians. He consulted Sanskrit scholars to prepare this account. \nOther kings who engaged in warfare included the Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They attempted to expand their control to the west and the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh. The best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very next year, in 1192. \nSultan - An Arabic term meaning ruler. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTake a look at Table 1 again. You will notice that after the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra until 1526. By then, Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals. This was also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs. \nSome of the states established in this period were small but powerful and extremely well administered. Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun (1530-1540, 1555-1556). Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty. Although the Sur dynasty ruled for only fifteen years (1540-1555), it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made them more efficient. Sher Shah\u2019s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar (1556-1605) when he consolidated the Mughal Empire. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the varying methods rulers used to demonstrate and consolidate their power, and how did these methods, particularly administrative and economic practices, affect wealth distribution across different social groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Demonstration and Consolidation of Power (Section 1 & 2):** Early rulers, such as those involved in the 'tripartite struggle' for Kanauj, demonstrated power through control of strategic territories. They also built large temples to display their resources and targeted wealthy temples during attacks, as exemplified by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, who used the wealth from raids (e.g., Somnath) to create a 'splendid capital city at Ghazni'. Later, Sher Shah Sur consolidated power through an efficient administration that became a 'model' for subsequent emperors like Akbar. This shows an evolution from territorial and military projection, often involving wealth extraction from religious sites, to sophisticated administrative efficiency. \n2.  **Impact on Wealth Distribution (Section 3):** The Mughal Empire's administrative and military efficiency led to 'great economic and commercial prosperity'. However, this wealth was distributed highly unequally. A small percentage of high-ranking mansabdars (5.6%) received a disproportionately large share (61.5%) of the empire's estimated revenue as salaries. While the expenditure by the elite benefited artisans and peasantry by creating demand, the 'scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan,' who often lived 'from hand to mouth.' In contrast, 'wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited.'\n3.  **Shifting Power and Wealth (Section 3):** As the Mughal emperor's authority declined, his former 'servants' emerged as 'powerful centres of power in the regions,' forming 'new dynasties' and consolidating 'independent political identities' in provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh, indicating a decentralization of wealth and power from the central empire to regional elites.\n\nAnswer: Rulers demonstrated and consolidated power through territorial control (e.g., Kanauj), military campaigns, and constructing grand temples, often targeting wealthy temples for resources (Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni used raid wealth for Ghazni). Later, efficient administration, like Sher Shah Sur's model, became crucial. Economically, the Mughal Empire experienced great prosperity, but wealth was highly unequal; a small fraction of high-ranking mansabdars received the majority of the revenue. While imperial expenditure benefited some artisans and peasants, the extensive revenue collection left primary producers with little for investment, leading to poverty for the poorest, while wealthier groups like merchants and bankers prospered. As imperial authority declined, former Mughal servants established independent regional dynasties, decentralizing power and wealth."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.4", "7.3.5", "7.4.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nContemporary historians and travellers give very scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Company Fights Back \n\n Unnerved by the scale of the upheaval, the Company decided to repress the revolt with all its might. It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum Zinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in November 1862. \nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the rebellion died down after that. People continued to resist and battle the British. The British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. Lucknow was taken in March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate awaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, chose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on all sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India and continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of many tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried and killed in April 1859. \nJust as victories against the British had earlier encouraged rebellion, the defeat of rebel forces encouraged desertions. The British also tried their best to win back the loyalty of the people. They announced rewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British, and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied. Nevertheless, hundreds of sepoys, rebels, nawabs and rajas were tried and hanged. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather than janas. The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red. One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and geometric patterns. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere were two major changes in agriculture around this time. One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Mauryan empire administer its vast territory, detailing the specific governance approaches and expected contributions from the region around Pataliputra, the provinces, the areas between centers, and the forested regions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for a detailed breakdown of Mauryan administrative strategies across different regions and their respective contributions, as described in the provided text. I will go through the first text section which explicitly details Mauryan administration.\n\n1.  **Region around Pataliputra:** The text states this area was 'under the direct control of the emperor'. Officials were appointed to collect taxes from 'farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders' in villages and towns.

Other provinces, like those ruled from Taxila or Ujjain, had some central control from Pataliputra, with royal princes often serving as governors, but local customs and rules were likely followed. In the vast areas between these centers, the Mauryas aimed to control roads and rivers for transport and collected resources such as blankets from the north-west and gold and precious stones from south India as tax and tribute. People in the forested regions were largely independent but were expected to provide elephants, timber, honey, and wax to Mauryan officials."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.3", "6.6.6", "8.5.4", "7.7.3", "6.6.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nNomadic pastoralists moved over long distances with their animals. They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what fundamental mercantile strategy did both the East India Company and the Banjaras employ to make a profit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text defines 'Mercantile' as a business that 'makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices.'

It was situated near areas where raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available. This was an important centre for making objects out of stone, shell and metal. There was also a store house in the city. Many seals and sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were found in this storehouse. \nA building that was found here was probably a workshop for making beads: pieces of stone, half made beads, tools for bead making, and finished beads have all been found here. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nProvincial autonomy - Capacity of the provinces to make relatively independent decisions while remaining within a federation. \nThe March to Dandi \n Purna Swaraj would never come on its own. It had to be fought for. In 1930, Gandhiji declared that he would lead a march to break the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi along with other nationalists reasoned that it was sinful to tax salt since it is such an essential item of our food. The Salt March related the general desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by everybody, and thus did not divide the rich and the poor. \nGandhiji and his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt. Peasants, tribals and women participated in large numbers. A business federation published a pamphlet on the salt issue. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were sent to jail. \nThe combined struggles of the Indian people bore fruit when the Government of India Act of 1935 prescribed provincial autonomy and the government announced elections to the provincial legislatures in 1937. The Congress formed governments in 7 out of 11 provinces. \nIn September 1939, after two years of Congress rule in the provinces, the Second World War broke out. Critical of Hitler, Congress leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to concede the demand.

In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n10 India After Independence \n\n A New and Divided Nation \n\n When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges. As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThrough the Eyes of the People \n\n To get a glimpse of what people were thinking those days about British rule, study Sources 1 and 2. \n The list of eighty-four rules \n Given here are excerpts from the book Majha Pravaas, written by Vishnubhatt Godse, a Brahman from a village in Maharashtra. He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the immediate and longer-term challenges India faced at the time of its independence in August 1947?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section, titled '10 India After Independence', directly addresses the challenges faced by India when it became independent in August 1947.

Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures.

So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down.

The Vikram Samvat has also been adopted alongside the Gregorian calendar as the national calendar by independent India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather than janas. The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red.

It had to be fought for. In 1930, Gandhiji declared that he would lead a march to break the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi along with other nationalists reasoned that it was sinful to tax salt since it is such an essential item of our food. The Salt March related the general desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by everybody, and thus did not divide the rich and the poor. \nGandhiji and his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt. Peasants, tribals and women participated in large numbers. A business federation published a pamphlet on the salt issue. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were sent to jail. \nThe combined struggles of the Indian people bore fruit when the Government of India Act of 1935 prescribed provincial autonomy and the government announced elections to the provincial legislatures in 1937. The Congress formed governments in 7 out of 11 provinces. \nIn September 1939, after two years of Congress rule in the provinces, the Second World War broke out. Critical of Hitler, Congress leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to concede the demand. The Congress ministries resigned in protest. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhile Magadha became a powerful kingdom, Vajji, with its capital at Vaishali (Bihar), was under a different form of government, known as gana or sangha. \nIn a gana or a sangha there were not one, but many rulers. Sometimes, even when thousands of men ruled together, each one was known as a raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through discussion and debate. For example, if they were attacked by an enemy, they met to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. However, women, dasas and kammakaras could not participate in these assemblies. \nBoth the Buddha and Mahavira (about whom you will read in Chapter 7) belonged to ganas or sanghas. Some of the most vivid descriptions of life in the sanghas can be found in Buddhist books. \nRajas of powerful kingdoms tried to conquer the sanghas. Nevertheless, these lasted for a very long time, till about 1500 years ago, when the last of the ganas or sanghas were conquered by the Gupta rulers, about whom you will read in Chapter 11. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Mughals were descendants of two great lineages of rulers. From their mother\u2019s side they were descendants of Genghis Khan (died 1227), the Mongol ruler who ruled over parts of China and Central Asia. From their father\u2019s side they were the successors of Timur (died 1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and modern-day Turkey. However, the Mughals did not like to be called Mughal or Mongol. This was because Genghis Khan\u2019s memory was associated with the massacre of innumerable people. It was also linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol competitors. On the other hand, the Mughals were proud of their Timurid ancestry, not least of all because their great ancestor had captured Delhi in 1398. They celebrated their genealogy pictorially, each ruler getting a picture made of Timur and himself. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nPaper has become a part of our daily lives. The books we read are printed on paper, and we use paper for writing. Paper was invented in China about 1900 years ago, by a man named Cai Lun. He beat plant fibres, cloth, rope and the bark of trees, soaked these in water, and then pressed, drained and dried the pulp to create paper. Even today, hand made paper is made through a similar process. \nThe technique of making paper was a closely guarded secret for centuries. It reached Korea about 1400 years ago, and spread to Japan soon after. It was known in Baghdad about 1800 years ago. From Baghdad it spread to Europe, Africa, and other parts of Asia including the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka \n Women from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement. During the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed to women\u2019s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the participation of women in the national movement, specifically during the Salt Satyagraha, differ from their role in the assemblies of a gana or sangha form of government?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section, 'Women in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka,' indicates that women participated significantly in the national movement, fighting for their right to do so, as seen when Sarojini Naidu persuaded Mahatma Gandhi to allow women to join the Salt Satyagraha. The third text section, 'The March to Dandi,' further confirms this by stating that 'women participated in large numbers' in the Salt March. In contrast, the second text section, which describes the gana or sangha form of government, explicitly states that 'women, dasas and kammakaras could not participate in these assemblies.' Therefore, women were actively involved and fought for their right to participate in the national movement and the Salt Satyagraha, while they were explicitly excluded from participation in the assemblies of a gana or sangha.\n\nAnswer: Women actively participated in the national movement and the Salt Satyagraha, even fighting for their right to join, as exemplified by their large numbers in the Salt March and Sarojini Naidu's persuasion of Gandhi.

Places where stone was found and where people made tools are known as factory sites. \nHow do we know where these factories were?

Sometimes, people lived here for longer spells of time. These sites are called habitation-cum-factory sites. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs traders journeyed to distant lands in caravans and ships, pilgrims often travelled with them. Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the distinctive architectural features and water management strategies employed in Hampi, and what cultural activities were central to its social life during its peak?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Architectural Features:** The text describes Hampi's architecture as distinctive, noting that buildings in the royal complex had 'splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures' and 'well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels.'

Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nProvincial autonomy - Capacity of the provinces to make relatively independent decisions while remaining within a federation. \nThe March to Dandi \n Purna Swaraj would never come on its own.

First, I will identify the administrative practices of early kingdoms from the section 'As in the case of earlier kings...'. This section states that land revenue was important, the village was the basic unit of administration, and kings adopted steps to win support of powerful men. These steps included making some administrative posts hereditary (e.g., a son succeeding his father, like Harishena), allowing one person to hold multiple offices (e.g., Harishena as maha-danda-nayaka, kumar-amatya, and sandhi-vigrahika), and involving important local men such as the nagarashreshthi, sarthavaha, prathama-kulika, and head of the kayasthas in local administration. \n2. Next, I will identify the record-keeping and information-gathering methods of the British administration from the section 'How do We Know?'. This text explains that the British believed in the importance of writing, which led to an administrative culture of memos, notings, and reports. They carefully preserved important documents in record rooms, archives, and museums. These documents were initially copied by calligraphists and later printed. \n3.

Census operations were conducted every ten years, recording information on population, castes, religions, and occupations. Other specialized surveys like botanical, zoological, archaeological, anthropological, and forest surveys were also common.\n4. Finally, I will contrast these two sets of practices. The early kingdoms focused on land revenue, village-level administration, and securing powerful individuals' loyalty through hereditary posts and local influence, without explicit mention of systematic written records or widespread surveying. In contrast, the British administration employed a highly systematic, written, and documented approach to governance, emphasizing detailed record-keeping, preservation, and comprehensive surveying for data collection and control.\n\nAnswer: The administrative practices of early kingdoms focused on land revenue as important, with the village serving as the basic unit of administration. Kings took steps to secure the support of powerful men, which included making some administrative posts hereditary (where sons succeeded fathers) and allowing one person to hold multiple offices simultaneously. Additionally, influential local figures such as the chief banker or merchant (nagarashreshthi), leader of merchant caravans (sarthavaha), chief craftsman (prathama-kulika), and head of scribes (kayasthas) likely had a say in local administration.\n\nIn contrast, the British administration employed highly systematic record-keeping and information-gathering methods. They believed that writing was crucial, which fostered an administrative culture of memos, notings, and reports.

Let\u2019s travel in our imagination to Thanjavur, the capital of the Cholas, as it was a thousand years ago. The perennial river Kaveri flows near this beautiful town. One hears the bells of the Rajarajeshvara temple built by King Rajaraja Chola. The towns people are all praise for its architect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan who has proudly carved his name on the temple wall. Inside is a massive Shiva linga. \nBesides the temple, there are palaces with mandapas or pavilions. Kings hold court in these mandapas, issuing orders to their subordinates. There are also barracks for the army. \nThe town is bustling with markets selling grain, spices, cloth and jewellery. Water supply for the town comes from wells and tanks. The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses.

Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLarge states like those of the Cholas (Chapter 2), Tughluqs (Chapter 3) or Mughals (Chapter 4) encompassed many regions. A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that are similar and circle those that are different. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nSiddhartha, also known as Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, was born about 2500 years ago. This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIf you look at Maps 1 and 2 closely, you will see something significant happening in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century. Notice how the boundaries of the Mughal Empire were reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent kingdoms. By 1765, notice how another power, the British, had successfully grabbed major chunks of territory in eastern India. What these maps tell us is that political conditions in eighteenthcentury India changed quite dramatically and within a relatively short span of time. \nIn this chapter we will read about the emergence of new political groups in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century \u2013 roughly from 1707, when Aurangzeb died, till the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did large, pan-regional empires, such as the Cholas and Mughals, interact with and influence the regional characteristics and languages across the Indian subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The question asks about the influence of large, pan-regional empires like the Cholas and Mughals on regional characteristics and languages.\n2. Section 3 states that dynasties like the Cholas and Mughals were able to build 'pan-regional' empires that spanned diverse regions.\n3. This section explains that 'years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions,' resulting in 'the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language.'\n4. Specifically concerning language, Section 3 references the poet Amir Khusrau's observation in 1318 that 'there was a different language in every region of this land,' which included various regional languages, contrasting them with Sanskrit which 'did not belong to any region.' This indicates that regional languages maintained their distinctiveness even under pan-regional rule.\n5. Section 4 further describes the Mughal influence, noting that they 'imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy,' which aligns with the impact on 'governance' mentioned in Section 3.\n6. Ultimately, Section 3 summarizes that 'These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness.'\n\nAnswer: Large pan-regional empires like the Cholas and Mughals significantly altered the character of the regions they encompassed through years of imperial rule. This led to the emergence of both distinct and shared traditions in governance, economic management, elite cultures, and language. For instance, the Mughals imposed structures of administration and governance that left a lasting political legacy. However, regions retained their distinctiveness, as evidenced by the persistence of numerous regional languages, which Amir Khusrau noted in 1318, distinguishing them from Sanskrit which was not regional. Thus, regions felt the impact of pan-regional integration without losing their unique characteristics."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.2", "6.7.1", "7.1.5", "7.4.1", "7.10.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIf somebody asks you the date, you will probably mention the day, month and year, 2000 and something. These years are counted from the date generally assigned to the birth of Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity. So, 2000 means 2000 years after the birth of Christ. All dates before the birth of Christ are counted backwards and usually have the letters BC (Before Christ) added on. In this book, we will refer to dates going back from the present, using 2000 as our starting point. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Kabir's teachings regarding social structure and religious practices contrast with the societal developments observed during the broader period between 700 and 1750, as described in the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section describes the period between 700 and 1750 as one where society became more differentiated, with people grouped into 'jatis or sub-castes' based on their backgrounds and occupations. It also mentions that new peasant groups were influenced by 'priests, monasteries and temples,' indicating the presence and influence of priestly classes and established religious practices. The third text section introduces Kabir, who lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries (a period falling within 700-1750). This section states that Kabir's teachings were based on a 'vehement rejection of the major religious traditions.' Specifically, he 'openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system.' Thus, Kabir's rejection of the caste system and priestly authority directly contrasted with the emerging social differentiation into jatis and the influence of priests and religious institutions described as prevalent during the broader historical period.\n\nAnswer: During the period between 700 and 1750, society became differentiated into jatis (sub-castes) based on background and occupation, and peasant groups were influenced by priests and religious institutions. In contrast, Kabir's teachings vehemently rejected the caste system, the pre-eminence of priestly classes, and all forms of external worship in both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.1.4", "6.1.6", "7.8.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Sal \u2013 A tree. Mahua \u2013 A flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol. Bewar \u2013 A term used in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation. \nHow Did Tribal Groups Live? \n\n By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities. Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n5 When People Rebel \n 1857 and After \n\n Policies and the People \n\n Nawabs lose their power Since the mid-eighteenth century, nawabs and rajas had seen their power erode. They had gradually lost their authority and honour. Residents had been stationed in many courts, the freedom of the rulers reduced, their armed forces disbanded, and their revenues and territories taken away by stages. \nMany ruling families tried to negotiate with the Company to protect their interests. For example, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi wanted the Company to recognise her adopted son as the heir to the kingdom after the death of her husband. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II, pleaded that he be given his father\u2019s pension when the latter died. However, the Company, confident of its superiority and military powers, turned down these pleas. \nAwadh was one of the last territories to be annexed. In 1801, a subsidiary alliance was imposed on Awadh, and in 1856 it was taken over. Governor -General Dalhousie declared that the territory was being misgoverned and British rule was needed to ensure proper administration. \nThe Company even began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the Company. In 1849, Gover nor -General Dalhousie announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king would be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another place in Delhi to reside in. In 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal king and after his death none of his descendants would be recognised as kings \u2013 they would just be called princes. \nThe peasants and the sepoys \n In the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection. Many failed to pay back their loans to the moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations. \nThe Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company also had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service. Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs. Did you know that in those days many people in the country believed that if they crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste? So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to Burma by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to go by the land route. They were severely punished, and since the issue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the Company\u2019s army had to agree to serve overseas if required. \nSepoys also reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of them were peasants and had families living in the villages. So the anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys. \nResponses to reforms \n The British believed that Indian society had to be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage of widows. English-language education was actively promoted. After 1830, the Company allowed Christian missionaries to function freely in its domain and even own land and property. In 1850, a new law was passed to make conversion to Christianity easier. This law allowed an Indian who had converted to Christianity to inherit the property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to feel that the British were destroying their religion, their social customs and their traditional way of life. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the distinct reasons for discontent among various social groups, including rulers, peasants, sepoys, and tribal communities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Rulers (Nawabs, Rajas, and Mughals):** The first text section, under 'Nawabs lose their power', explicitly states that nawabs and rajas 'had seen their power erode', 'lost their authority and honour', had their 'freedom...reduced', 'armed forces disbanded', and 'revenues and territories taken away'. Specific examples include Rani Lakshmibai's request for her adopted son to be recognized as heir and Nana Saheb's plea for his father\u2019s pension, both of which were 'turned down'. For the Mughals, the Company 'began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end' by removing the king's name from coins, planning to shift the king's family out of the Red Fort, and declaring Bahadur Shah Zafar as the last Mughal king, with descendants only recognized as princes. Awadh was also annexed under the pretext of 'misgoverned'.\n2.  **Peasants:** The first text section, under 'The peasants and the sepoys', states that peasants 'resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection'. Many 'failed to pay back their loans to the moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations'.\n3.  **Sepoys:** The same section notes that Indian sepoys were 'unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service'. Furthermore, 'Some of the new rules...violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs', such as the order to go to Burma by sea route in 1824 and the 1856 law requiring overseas service, which many believed would lead to losing their religion and caste. The text also mentions that the 'anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys' because many were peasants with families in villages.\n4.  **Tribal Communities:** The second text section, 'How Did Tribal Groups Live?', highlights their dependence on 'traders and moneylenders'. Traders 'sold the goods at high prices' and moneylenders charged 'very high' interest on loans, leading to 'debt and poverty'. Consequently, tribals 'came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery'. Additionally, the British view of them as 'wild and savage' who 'needed to be settled and civilised' implies a threat to their traditional ways of life, such as jhum cultivation which depended on 'free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests'.\n\nAnswer: Rulers experienced a loss of power, authority, honor, and territory, with their pleas and succession rights denied by the Company. Peasants resented high taxes, rigid revenue collection, and lost their ancestral lands due to debt. Sepoys were discontent with their pay, allowances, conditions of service, and new rules that violated their religious beliefs, such as mandatory overseas service. Tribal communities suffered from debt and poverty due to high prices from traders and exorbitant interest rates from moneylenders, whom they viewed as 'evil outsiders,' and faced threats to their traditional way of life from British officials who deemed them 'wild and savage' and sought to 'civilise' them."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.5.1", "8.4.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Map 1 was made in 1154 CE by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi. The section reproduced here is a detail of the Indian subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The two maps are quite different even though they are of the same area. In al-Idrisi\u2019s map, south India is where we would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the island at the top. Place-names are marked in Arabic, and there are some well-known names like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (spelt in the map as Qanauj). Map 2 was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during which time information about the subcontinent had changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly detailed. This map was used by European sailors and merchants on their voyages (see Chapter 6). \nEqually important is the fact that the science of cartography differed in the two periods.

Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Take a look at Table 1 again and identify the five dynasties that together made the Delhi Sultanate. \nThe rulers of Delhi - Table 1 - RAJPUT DYNASTIES : Tomaras Early twelfth century-1165, Ananga Pala 1130-1145, Chauhans 1165-1192, Prithviraj Chauhan 1175-1192 - EARLY TURKISH RULERS 1206-1290 : Qutbuddin Aybak 1206-1210, Shamsuddin Iltutmish 1210-1236, Raziyya 1236-1240, Ghiyasuddin Balban 1266-1287 - KHALJI DYNASTY 1290-1320 : Jalaluddin Khalji 1290-1296, Alauddin Khalji 1296-1316 - TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 1320-1414 : Ghiyasuddin Tughluq 1320-1324, Muhammad Tughluq 1324-1351, Firuz Shah Tughluq 1351-1388 - SAYYID DYNASTY 1414-1451 : Khizr Khan 1414-1421 - LODI DYNASTY 1451-1526 : Bahlul Lodi 1451-1489 \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nSome of the best\u2013known epics were written during this period. Epics are grand, long compositions, about heroic men and women, and include stories about gods. \nA famous Tamil epic, the Silappadikaram, was composed by a poet named Ilango, around 1800 years ago. It is the story of a merchant named Kovalan, who lived in Puhar and fell in love with a courtesan named Madhavi, neglecting his wife Kannagi. Later, he and Kannagi left Puhar and went to Madurai, where he was wrongly accused of theft by the court jeweller of the Pandya king. The king sentenced Kovalan to death. Kannagi, who still loved him, was full of grief and anger at this injustice, and destroyed the entire city of Madurai. \nAnother Tamil epic, the Manimekalai was composed by Sattanar around 1400 years ago. This describes the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi. These beautiful compositions were lost to scholars for many centuries, till their manuscripts were rediscovered, about a hundred years ago. \nOther writers, such as Kalidasa, (about whom you read in Chapter 11) wrote in Sanskrit. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nLarge states like those of the Cholas (Chapter 2), Tughluqs (Chapter 3) or Mughals (Chapter 4) encompassed many regions. A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned.

It first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were later defeated by the Chauhans.\n2.  **Commercial Significance**: Under the Tomaras and Chauhans, Delhi became an \"important commercial centre.\" Rich Jaina merchants lived there, and coins minted in Delhi, called 'dehliwal', had a wide circulation.\n3.  **Transformation to Pan-regional Capital**: Delhi's transformation into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent began with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the early thirteenth century. The text lists the five dynasties that made up the Delhi Sultanate: Early Turkish Rulers, Khalji, Tughluq, Sayyid, and Lodi.\n4.  **Pan-regional Rule Claims**: The text mentions that large states like the Tughluqs (part of the Delhi Sultanate) encompassed many regions. Specifically, a Sanskrit prashasti praised Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287), claiming he ruled a vast empire from Bengal in the east to Ghazni in Afghanistan in the west, and included all of south India, demonstrating the ambition for pan-regional control from Delhi.\n5.  **Linguistic Diversity (Amir Khusrau's Observations)**: In 1318, during the Tughluq Dynasty (a period of Delhi-centered pan-regional rule), the poet Amir Khusrau noted that \"there was a different language in every region of this land,\" listing languages like Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Telangani, Gujari, Ma\u2018bari, Gauri, Awadhi, and Hindawi. He also pointed out that Sanskrit \"did not belong to any region\" and was not known by \"common people.\"\n6.  **Synthesis of Delhi's Development and Regional Distinctiveness**: While Delhi rose to become the political and commercial capital of powerful pan-regional empires like the Delhi Sultanate, Amir Khusrau's contemporary observations reveal that significant linguistic diversity persisted across the various regions of the subcontinent. This illustrates that despite efforts at political integration by central powers like the Delhi Sultanate, the cultural and linguistic distinctiveness of the regions endured, reinforcing the idea stated in the text that regions \"felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness.\"\n\nAnswer: Delhi emerged as a significant city in the twelfth century, first as a capital under the Tomara Rajputs and Chauhans, developing into an important commercial center where 'dehliwal' coins were widely circulated. Its transformation into a capital controlling vast areas of the subcontinent began with the Delhi Sultanate in the early thirteenth century, encompassing several dynasties and leading to claims of pan-regional rule by figures like Ghiyasuddin Balban. However, despite this political centralization, the poet Amir Khusrau's observations in 1318, during the Tughluq Dynasty, highlighted the enduring regional distinctiveness by noting 'a different language in every region of this land,' contrasting with Sanskrit which was not a common, regional language. This demonstrates that even as Delhi became the hub of pan-regional empires, diverse regional linguistic identities persisted throughout the subcontinent."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.12.6", "6.10.9", "7.1.1", "7.1.5", "7.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Among them were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis. They advocated renunciation of the world. To them the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realisation of oneness with it. To achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation. These groups became particularly popular among \u201clow\u201d castes. Their criticism of conventional religion created the ground for devotional religion to become a popular force in northern India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities.

Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago.

The text states that 'Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver.' It also mentions 'spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience' and 'pots with beautiful black designs.'\n\nNext, I will list the purposes for which these materials were used. According to the text, 'Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels.' 'Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels.' 'Harappans also made seals out of stone' and 'beads, weights, and blades' were striking finds, likely made from stone. Spindle whorls were 'used to spin thread.'\n\nFinally, I will identify indications of specialized labor. The text explicitly states, 'Many of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists.' It defines a 'specialist' as 'a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals.' The text further supports this by referring to an illustration (not provided here, but mentioned in the text) of a 'well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown,' concluding 'This must have been the work of an expert crafts person.' The discovery of spindle whorls also implies specialized knowledge in textile production (spinning thread). The second text section discusses religious groups and is not relevant to this question about Harappan materials and labor.\n\nAnswer: The Harappans utilized a diverse array of materials including stone, shell, copper, bronze, gold, silver, terracotta, and faience. Copper and bronze were fashioned into tools, weapons, ornaments, and vessels, while gold and silver were used for ornaments and vessels. Stone was used for seals, beads, weights, and blades, and terracotta and faience were used for spindle whorls to spin thread. The presence of specialized labor is strongly indicated by the text, which defines specialists as individuals trained for specific tasks like cutting stone, polishing beads, or carving seals. The intricate craftsmanship, such as well-carved faces and carefully shown beards (as referenced in the text), points to the work of expert craftspersons, suggesting that not everybody was a specialist but rather certain individuals possessed advanced skills in particular trades."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.5", "7.8.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe last and 24th tirthankara of the Jainas, Vardhamana Mahavira, also spread his message around this time, i.e. 2500 years ago. He was a kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha, about which you read in Chapter 6. At the age of thirty, he left home and went to live in a forest. For twelve years he led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment. \nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes. They must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings. \u201cAll beings,\u201d said Mahavira \u201clong to live. To all things life is dear.\u201d Ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers, because they used Prakrit. There were several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of the country, and named after the regions in which they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken in Magadha was known as Magadhi. \nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and were especially asked not to steal. Also, they had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up everything, including their clothes. \nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands left their homes to learn and teach this new way of life. Many more remained behind and supported those who became monks and nuns, providing them with food. \nJainism was supported mainly by traders. Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and his followers were transmitted orally for several centuries. They were written down in the form in which they are presently available at a place called Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see Map 7, page 113). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nVikram Samvat The era beginning in the 58 BCE is traditionally associated with Gupta king, Chandragupta II, who had founded it as a mark of victory over the Shakas and assumed the title of Vikramaditya.

They needed large, compact blocks of land but could only acquire small, scattered plots. Attempting to lease land and evict peasants led to conflicts.\n2.  **Labor mobilization**: A large plantation required many laborers, but labor was needed precisely when peasants were busy with their rice cultivation.\n3.  **Equipment**: Large-scale 'nij' cultivation demanded many ploughs and bullocks (two ploughs per bigha). Investing in their purchase and maintenance was a significant problem, and supplies were hard to obtain from peasants whose ploughs and bullocks were occupied with rice fields.\n\nFor the 'ryoti' cultivation system, the challenges for the cultivators were:\n1.  **Low prices and debt trap**: Peasants received very low prices for the indigo they produced, leading to an unending cycle of loans despite initial cash advances.\n2.  **Soil depletion and crop displacement**: Planters insisted on cultivating indigo on the best soils, which peasants preferred for growing rice. Moreover, indigo had deep roots and rapidly exhausted the soil, making it unsuitable for rice cultivation after an indigo harvest.\n\nAnswer: Under the 'nij' system, planters faced challenges in expanding cultivation due to the scarcity of large, compact fertile land, conflicts arising from attempts to evict peasants, difficulties in mobilizing labor when peasants were busy with rice, and the high cost and unavailability of numerous ploughs and bullocks. Under the 'ryoti' system, cultivators struggled with receiving very low prices for their indigo, which trapped them in an endless cycle of debt, and were forced to grow indigo on their best soils, which exhausted the land and prevented them from growing rice afterwards."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.9", "6.7.5", "6.4.4", "6.11.3", "8.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development. There was a broad agreement on what was called a \u201cmixed economy\u201d model. Here, both the State and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs. What, specifically, these roles were to be \u2013 which industries should be initiated by the state and which by the market, how to achieve a balance between the different regions and states \u2013 was to be defined by the Planning Commission. \nIn 1956, the Second Five Year Plan was formulated. This focused strongly on the development of heavy industries such as steel, and on the building of large dams. These sectors would be under the control of the State. This focus on heavy industry, and the effort at state regulation of the economy was to guide economic policy for the next few decades.

A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi).

Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the administrative structure of Akbar's empire, including its divisions and key officials, and explain the core tenets of his policy of \"sulh-i kul.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details Akbar's administration in the 'Ain-i Akbari,' stating that the empire was divided into 'subas' (provinces). Each 'suba' was governed by a 'subadar' who performed both political and military duties. Additionally, each province had a 'diwan' for financial matters. The 'subadar' was supported by other officials, including the 'bakhshi' (military paymaster), 'sadr' (minister for religious and charitable patronage), 'faujdars' (military commanders), and 'kotwal' (town police commander). Regarding 'sulh-i kul,' the text explains that Akbar developed this idea after realizing that religious scholars emphasizing ritual and dogma were bigots, causing division. 'Sulh-i kul' is defined as 'universal peace,' an idea of tolerance that did not discriminate between people of different religions, but instead focused on a universally applicable system of ethics: honesty, justice, and peace. Abul Fazl helped frame this vision of governance, which was also followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan.\n\nAnswer: Akbar's empire was divided into provinces called 'subas,' each governed by a 'subadar' handling both political and military functions, alongside a 'diwan' as the financial officer. Other key officials supporting the 'subadar' included the 'bakhshi' (military paymaster), 'sadr' (minister for religious and charitable patronage), 'faujdars' (military commanders), and 'kotwal' (town police commander).

These included the Banjaras (see also Chapter 7). Several traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors who bought horses. \nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards \u2013 the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. \nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China. \nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive. This eventually drew European traders to India. We will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns. \nWith its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in present-day Afghanistan) became politically and commercially important from the sixteenth century onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was primarily carried on through this route. In the seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum in those days. Camels carried dried fruits, dates, carpets, silks and even fresh fruits from Kabul to the subcontinent and elsewhere. Slaves were also brought here for sale. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhile Magadha became a powerful kingdom, Vajji, with its capital at Vaishali (Bihar), was under a different form of government, known as gana or sangha. \nIn a gana or a sangha there were not one, but many rulers. Sometimes, even when thousands of men ruled together, each one was known as a raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through discussion and debate. For example, if they were attacked by an enemy, they met to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. However, women, dasas and kammakaras could not participate in these assemblies. \nBoth the Buddha and Mahavira (about whom you will read in Chapter 7) belonged to ganas or sanghas. Some of the most vivid descriptions of life in the sanghas can be found in Buddhist books. \nRajas of powerful kingdoms tried to conquer the sanghas. Nevertheless, these lasted for a very long time, till about 1500 years ago, when the last of the ganas or sanghas were conquered by the Gupta rulers, about whom you will read in Chapter 11. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe city of Dholavira was located on Khadir Beyt (also spelled as Bet) in the Rann of Kutch, where there was fresh water and fertile soil. Unlike some of the other Harappan cities, which were divided into two parts, Dholavira was divided into three parts, and each part was surrounded with massive stone walls, with entrances through gateways. There was also a large open area in the settlement, where public ceremonies could be held. Other finds include large letters of the Harappan script that were carved out of white stone and perhaps inlaid in wood. This is a unique find as generally Harappan writing has been found on small objects such as seals. \nThe city of Lothal stood beside a tributary of the Sabarmati, in Gujarat, close to the Gulf of Khambat. It was situated near areas where raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available. This was an important centre for making objects out of stone, shell and metal. There was also a store house in the city. Many seals and sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were found in this storehouse. \nA building that was found here was probably a workshop for making beads: pieces of stone, half made beads, tools for bead making, and finished beads have all been found here. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nYou may have heard about the Vedas. There are four of them \u2013 the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or \u201cwell-said\u201d. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. \nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis). Priests taught students to recite and memorise each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with great care. Most of the hymns were composed, taught and learnt by men. A few were composed by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. \nThe books we use are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After \n\n In March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary factors that empowered the indigo ryots to rebel in 1859, and how did the British government initially respond to the escalating rebellion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text identifies two main factors that empowered the indigo ryots to rebel in 1859: \n1.  **Support from local authorities:** The ryots 'felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen'.

They were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages they visited, and set them to music. \nThere were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different caste backgrounds such as potters, \u201cuntouchable\u201d workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and chiefs. The best known among them were Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are two sets of compilations of their songs \u2013 Tevaram and Tiruvacakam. There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally divergent backgrounds, the best known being Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya Prabandham. \nBetween the tenth and twelfth centuries the Chola and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening the links between the bhakti tradition and temple worship. This was also the time when their poems were compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also composed. Today we use these texts as sources for writing histories of the bhakti tradition. \nHagiography : Writing of saints\u2019 lives. \nThis is a composition of Manikkavasagar: Into my vile body of flesh You came, as though it were a temple of gold, And soothed me wholly and saved me, O Lord of Grace, O Gem most Pure, Sorrow and birth and death and illusion You took from me, and set me free. O Bliss! O Light! I have taken refuge in You, And never can I be parted from You. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAlthough inscriptions, coins and architecture provide a lot of information, especially valuable are \u201chistories\u201d, tarikh (singular)/tawarikh (plural), written in Persian, the language of administration under the Delhi Sultans. The authors of tawarikh were learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. \nThe circle of justice - Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century: A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king promotes justice and honest governance. \nKeep the following additional details in mind: (1) the authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. (3) These authors advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared by everybody. \nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmish\u2019s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. She was removed from the throne in 1240. \nBirthright - Privileges claimed on account of birth. For example, people believed that nobles inherited their rights to govern, because they were born in certain families. Gender distinctions - Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women. \nWhat Minhaj-i Siraj thought about Raziyya? Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore asked: \u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi (1262- 1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in Kashmir (980- 1003). Her title is interesting: it comes from \u201cdidi\u201d or \u201celder sister\u201d, an obviously affectionate term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Inamgaon on Map 2 (page14).

This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago. He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Prior to the development of Mahayana Buddhism, how was the Buddha's enlightenment typically represented, and what historical event and specific symbol inspired this earlier method of representation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text states that 'Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs.

The towns people are all praise for its architect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan who has proudly carved his name on the temple wall.

The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses.

They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red.

Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the administrative structure and significant cultural or religious policies implemented during Akbar's reign, and detail the key artistic and architectural achievements of the Chola dynasty."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first extract details about Akbar's administrative structure and cultural/religious policies from the relevant section. The text in the second section explicitly states that Akbar's empire was divided into 'subas' governed by a 'subadar' (who carried out both political and military functions) and a 'diwan' (financial officer). It further lists supporting officers for the subadar: 'bakhshi' (military paymaster), 'sadr' (minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage), 'faujdars' (military commanders), and 'kotwal' (town police commander). For cultural/religious policies, it mentions Akbar's idea of 'sulh-i kul' (universal peace) promoting tolerance and ethics, and his commissioning of Sanskrit work translations into Persian via a 'Maktab Khana'.\n\nNext, I will identify the key artistic and architectural achievements of the Chola dynasty. The text in the third section describes Thanjavur, the Chola capital, highlighting the Rajarajeshvara temple built by King Rajaraja Chola, which contained a massive Shiva linga. It also mentions the Saliya weavers who produced various types of cloth and the 'sthapatis' or sculptors at Svamimalai who made exquisite bronze idols and tall, ornamental bell metal lamps.\n\nAnswer: During Akbar's reign, the administrative structure involved the empire being divided into 'subas' (provinces), each governed by a 'subadar' responsible for both political and military functions, and a 'diwan' who served as the financial officer. The subadar was supported by other officers such as the 'bakhshi' (military paymaster), 'sadr' (minister for religious and charitable patronage), 'faujdars' (military commanders), and the 'kotwal' (town police commander). Significant cultural and religious policies included the implementation of 'sulh-i kul' or 'universal peace', an idea of tolerance that focused on ethics like honesty, justice, and peace, applicable to all subjects regardless of their religion. Akbar also established a 'Maktab Khana' at Fatehpur Sikri to commission the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian.\n\nFor the Chola dynasty, key artistic and architectural achievements included the construction of the Rajarajeshvara temple in Thanjavur by King Rajaraja Chola, which housed a massive Shiva linga. The town of Thanjavur and nearby Uraiyur were known for Saliya weavers producing various types of cloth, including fine cottons for royalty and coarse cotton for the masses. Additionally, at Svamimalai, 'sthapatis' or sculptors created exquisite bronze idols and tall, ornamental bell metal lamps."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.6.3", "7.4.8", "7.6.2", "6.11.9"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together. There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFrom the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns. These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain. Some of these taxes were collected in kind, while others were collected in cash. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary differences in economic organization and resource ownership between the small towns that emerged from the eighth century and tribal societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Economic Organization of Towns (Section 1):** The text describes towns as having 'mandapika (or mandi)' and 'market streets called hatta (haat) lined with shops,' indicating a market-based economy driven by trade. Villagers brought produce to sell, and traders bought local articles while selling products from distant places. Authorities like samantas or zamindars 'levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade,' demonstrating a system of taxation and a more complex, hierarchical economic structure.\n2.  **Resource Ownership in Towns (Section 1):** While not explicitly stating 'private ownership,' the presence of 'shops,' 'traders,' 'artisans,' and 'taxes on articles of trade' implies individual or group ownership of businesses, goods, and the means of production, which were subject to taxation.\n3.  **Economic Organization of Tribal Societies (Section 2):** The text states that members of a tribe 'follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing.' The description of labor division (women for agriculture, men for herds) suggests a subsistence-based economy focused on communal production and survival rather than extensive trade and taxation.\n4.  **Resource Ownership in Tribal Societies (Section 2):** The text explicitly highlights a key difference: 'land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together.' Furthermore, it notes, 'There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor,' indicating an egalitarian approach to economic resources and wealth.\n5.  **Synthesis of Differences:** The towns had a market-oriented economy with trade, specialized artisans, and a system of taxation levied by authorities, implying private or controlled ownership of economic assets. Tribal societies, conversely, operated on a subsistence economy with communal ownership of natural resources (land, forests, grasslands, water) and an absence of significant economic disparity among their members.\n\nAnswer: The small towns featured a market-based economy with extensive trade, specialized artisans, and a system where authorities like samantas or zamindars levied taxes on traders, artisans, and articles of trade. In contrast, tribal societies operated on a subsistence economy involving hunting, gathering, farming, herding, and fishing, with land, forests, grasslands, and water regarded as the shared wealth of the entire tribe, leading to no sharp differences between the rich and the poor."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.4", "6.3.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nOver centuries, India\u2019s intellectual exploration of truth has come to be represented by six systems of philosophy.

This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Rome on Map 6 (page 84).

Rome was the capital of one of the largest empires \u2014 one that spread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Augustus, one of the most important emperors, who ruled about 2000 years ago, said that he found Rome a city of brick, and made it into a city of marble. He, and later rulers, built temples and palaces. \nThey also built huge amphitheatres \u2014 open arenas surrounded by tiers of seats \u2014 where citizens could watch all kinds of shows, and public baths (with separate timings for men and women), where people met and relaxed.

Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nArchaeologists think that objects found with a skeleton probably belonged to the dead person. Sometimes, more objects are found in one grave than in another. Find Brahmagiri on Map 2 (page 14). Here, one skeleton was buried with 33 gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and one conch shell. Other skeletons have only a few pots. These finds suggest that there was some difference in status amongst the people who were buried. Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFranchise \u2013 The right to vote. \n \nA Constitution is Written \n\n Between December 1946 and November 1949, some three hundred Indians had a series of meetings on the country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Considering how historians analyze social and economic transformations over time, what were the key features of the Indian Constitution, as framed by the Constituent Assembly, that specifically aimed to address historical social and economic inequalities within the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text highlights that historians study time as a reflection of \"changes in social and economic organisation,\" emphasizing the importance of societal transformation. The second text details the framing of the Indian Constitution by the Constituent Assembly between December 1946 and November 1949. To address historical social and economic inequalities, the Constitution incorporated several key features:\n\n1.  **Universal adult franchise:** It granted the right to vote to all Indians above the age of 21, irrespective of gender, class, or education. This was described as a \"revolutionary step\" that ensured political equality, contrasting with the gradual and limited enfranchisement in other countries like the UK and US.\n2.  **Equality before the law:** The Constitution guaranteed equality to all citizens \"regardless of their caste or religious affiliation.\" This explicitly rejected the idea of a Hindu state and ensured equal rights and opportunities for all religious communities, including Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, and Jains, alongside Hindus.\n3.  **Special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged:** This involved the abolition of \"untouchability,\" opening Hindu temples to all castes (including former untouchables), and recommending \"reservation\" of a certain percentage of seats in legislatures and jobs in government for members of the \"lowest castes\" (now known as Harijans or Scheduled Castes) and \"adivasis or Scheduled Tribes.\" These measures were explicitly intended to \"make amends\" for historical deprivation and discrimination, as argued by members like H.J. Khandekar. These features collectively aimed to dismantle centuries-old social hierarchies and economic disparities, aligning with Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's vision for economic and social democracy alongside political democracy.\n\nAnswer: The Indian Constitution addressed historical social and economic inequalities by adopting universal adult franchise, guaranteeing equality before the law for all citizens regardless of caste or religious affiliation, and providing special privileges for the disadvantaged through the abolition of untouchability and the reservation of seats and jobs for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.1.7", "8.10.2", "6.5.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nXuan Zang, and other pilgrims spent time studying in Nalanda, (Bihar) the most famous Buddhist monastery of the period. This is how he describes it: \u201cThe teachers are men of the highest ability and talent. They follow the teachings of the Buddha in all sincerity. The rules of the monastery are strict, and everyone has to follow them. Discussions are held throughout the day, and the old and the young mutually help one another. Learned men from different cities come here to settle their doubts. The gatekeeper asks new entrants difficult questions. They are allowed to enter only after they have been able to answer these. Seven or eight out of every ten are not able to answer.\u201d \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe sants had much in common with the Sufis, so much so that it is believed that they adopted many ideas of each other. Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was in no other place. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nYou may have noticed how wealth is measured in terms of coins in the story on page 90. Archaeologists have found several thousands of coins belonging to this period. The earliest coins which were in use for about 500 years were punch marked coins, \nPunch-marked coins were generally rectangular or sometimes square or round in shape, either cut out of metal sheets or made out of flattened metal globules (a small spherical body). The coins were not inscribed, but were stamped with symbols using dies or punches. Hence, they are called punch-marked coins. These coins are found over most parts of the subcontinent and remained in circulation till the early centuries CE. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the immediate and long-term challenges faced by India upon its independence in August 1947, and how were the problems of unity and development interconnected in addressing these challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that when India became independent in August 1947, it faced immediate challenges including finding homes and jobs for 8 million refugees from Partition and persuading almost 500 princely states to join the new nation.

In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made. These developments took place simultaneously, i.e. at the same time. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of the book. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period. At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhat would a traveller visiting a medieval town expect to find?

This highlights a focus on administration, resource management, specialized crafts, and internal city roles.\n2. **Identify Medieval Town Functions (Section 4):** The fourth text explains that medieval towns had diverse functions, which could include being a temple town, an administrative centre, a commercial town, or a port town. It also notes that many towns combined several of these functions.\n3. **Compare and Contrast:** The Harappan city description focuses on the specific roles of people within the city (rulers, scribes, craftspersons) and their activities related to governance, resource acquisition, and production. In contrast, the medieval towns are characterized by their overarching societal purpose or identity (e.g., religious, governmental, trade-oriented), often integrating multiple such functions. While both periods involved craft production, the medieval period explicitly categorizes towns by their primary functional identity, suggesting a more diversified and specialized urban landscape in terms of purpose.\n\nAnswer: A Harappan city was characterized by specific roles such as rulers planning construction, acquiring resources from distant lands, and keeping valuables, alongside scribes who helped with writing and craftspersons producing goods. In contrast, medieval towns were identified by their diverse functions, which could include being a temple town, an administrative centre, a commercial town, or a port town, with many often combining several of these roles, indicating a more varied and specialized urban purpose."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.4", "7.1.4", "6.8.9", "7.6.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later. The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in large library collections. \nArchive - A place where documents and manuscripts are stored. Today all national and state governments have archives where they keep all their old official records and transactions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThese stone boulders are known as megaliths (literally big stones). These were carefully arranged by people, and were used to mark burial sites. The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. \nSome important megalithic sites are shown on Map 2 (page14). While some megaliths can be seen on the surface, other megalithic burials are often underground. \nSometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground. These are the only indications that there are burials beneath. \nThere were several things that people did to make megaliths. We have made a list here. Try and arrange them in the correct order: digging pits in the earth, transporting stones, breaking boulders, placing stones in position, finding suitable stone, shaping stones, burying the dead. \nAll these burials have some common features. Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. Also found are tools and weapons of iron and sometimes, skeletons of horses, horse equipment and ornaments of stone and gold. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka \n Women from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement. During the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed to women\u2019s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAbout 2500 years ago, some janapadas became more important than others, and were known as mahajanapadas. Some of these are shown on Map 4. Most mahajanapadas had a capital city, many of these were fortified. This means that huge walls of wood, brick or stone were built around them. \nForts were probably built because people were afraid of attacks from other kings and needed protection. It is also likely that some rulers wanted to show how rich and powerful they were by building really large, tall and impressive walls around their cities. Also in this way, the land and the people living inside the fortified area could be controlled more easily by the king. Building such huge walls required a great deal of planning. Thousands, if not lakhs of bricks or stones had to be prepared. This in turn meant enormous labour, provided, possibly, by thousands of men, women and children. And resources had to be found for all of this. \nThe new rajas now began maintaining armies. Soldiers were paid regular salaries and maintained by the king throughout the year. Some payments were probably made using punch marked coins (see the illustration on page 92). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIf somebody asks you the date, you will probably mention the day, month and year, 2000 and something.

Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nContemporary historians and travellers give very scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Given that tribal people did not keep written records, what primary method do present-day historians use to reconstruct their histories?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The second text section explicitly states that \"tribal people did not keep written records.\" However, it immediately follows by noting that \"But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions.

Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMercantile \u2013 A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices \nEast India Company Comes East \n\n In 1800, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\n\u201cGeneral\u201dconstituencies - Election districts with no reservations for any religious or other community \nQuit India and Later \n\n Mahatma Gandhi decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British in the middle of the Second World War. The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's establishment of trade and political dominance in Bengal, as detailed in the text, contribute to the conditions that later led to the rise of mass nationalist movements against British rule in India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **East India Company's initial strategy and political maneuvering (Text 2):** The East India Company secured a royal charter granting it the sole right to trade with the East, aiming to buy goods cheaply and sell them at higher prices. They established their first factory in Bengal in 1651 and expanded their presence by bribing Mughal officials for zamindari rights and duty-free trade through a 'farman' from Emperor Aurangzeb. Company officials misused these privileges for private trade, causing significant revenue loss for Bengal and leading to intense conflicts with local Nawabs like Murshid Quli Khan, Alivardi Khan, and Sirajuddaulah, who resisted the Company's demands and fortifications.\n2. **Consolidation of power and economic exploitation (Text 2):** The Battle of Plassey in 1757, a major victory for the Company orchestrated by Robert Clive's manipulation of Mir Jafar, led to the assassination of Sirajuddaulah and the installation of puppet nawabs. When these puppet rulers proved uncooperative, the Company deposed them (e.g., Mir Jafar, Mir Qasim). Ultimately, in 1765, the Company was appointed the Diwan of Bengal, which allowed it to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal to finance its trade, maintain troops, and cover administrative costs, effectively stopping the outflow of gold from Britain and solidifying its political and economic control over the region.\n3. **Laying groundwork for mass discontent (Text 1 & 4):** This systematic establishment of British economic and political dominance created the conditions for widespread grievances. The 'Growth of Mass Nationalism' section (Text 1) explains that after 1919, the struggle against British rule became a mass movement due to factors such as a 'huge rise in the defence expenditure' leading to increased taxes and a 'sharp rise in prices' for common people after World War I, alongside the exploitation of soldiers and the curbing of fundamental rights by acts like the Rowlatt Act. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre and other repressive measures further fueled public anger. Mahatma Gandhi's emergence as a mass leader, organizing movements like the Rowlatt Satyagraha and Non-Cooperation Movement (Text 1), and later the Quit India Movement (Text 4), mobilized diverse sections of society against the established British Raj, which had its origins in the Company's early actions and subsequent policies of exploitation and control.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company's early establishment of trade and political dominance in Bengal, achieved through securing exclusive trading rights, bribing Mughal officials for duty-free trade and zamindari, manipulating local rulers through battles like Plassey, and ultimately acquiring the Diwani of Bengal, created the foundation for British colonial exploitation. This systemic control led to increased taxes, rising prices, and the curbing of fundamental rights under British rule, fostering widespread discontent. These grievances, in turn, fueled the later emergence of mass nationalist movements, led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, who mobilized various sections of Indian society against the British Raj and eventually demanded independence."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.9.2", "8.2.2", "7.1.7", "8.9.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists.

Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century.

These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain. Some of these taxes were collected in kind, while others were collected in cash. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n5 When People Rebel \n 1857 and After \n\n Policies and the People \n\n Nawabs lose their power Since the mid-eighteenth century, nawabs and rajas had seen their power erode. They had gradually lost their authority and honour. Residents had been stationed in many courts, the freedom of the rulers reduced, their armed forces disbanded, and their revenues and territories taken away by stages. \nMany ruling families tried to negotiate with the Company to protect their interests. For example, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi wanted the Company to recognise her adopted son as the heir to the kingdom after the death of her husband. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II, pleaded that he be given his father\u2019s pension when the latter died. However, the Company, confident of its superiority and military powers, turned down these pleas. \nAwadh was one of the last territories to be annexed. In 1801, a subsidiary alliance was imposed on Awadh, and in 1856 it was taken over. Governor -General Dalhousie declared that the territory was being misgoverned and British rule was needed to ensure proper administration. \nThe Company even began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the Company. In 1849, Gover nor -General Dalhousie announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king would be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another place in Delhi to reside in. In 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal king and after his death none of his descendants would be recognised as kings \u2013 they would just be called princes. \nThe peasants and the sepoys \n In the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection. Many failed to pay back their loans to the moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations. \nThe Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company also had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service. Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs. Did you know that in those days many people in the country believed that if they crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste? So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to Burma by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to go by the land route. They were severely punished, and since the issue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the Company\u2019s army had to agree to serve overseas if required. \nSepoys also reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of them were peasants and had families living in the villages. So the anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys. \nResponses to reforms \n The British believed that Indian society had to be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage of widows. English-language education was actively promoted. After 1830, the Company allowed Christian missionaries to function freely in its domain and even own land and property. In 1850, a new law was passed to make conversion to Christianity easier. This law allowed an Indian who had converted to Christianity to inherit the property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to feel that the British were destroying their religion, their social customs and their traditional way of life. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka \n Women from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement. During the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed to women\u2019s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the main grievances of Indian rulers, peasants, and sepoys against the British East India Company's policies leading up to the mid-19th century, and how did some Indians perceive British social reforms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for the grievances of specific groups (Indian rulers, peasants, sepoys) against the British East India Company and the perception of British social reforms, based solely on the provided text. The second text section, '5 When People Rebel 1857 and After,' directly addresses these points.\n\n1.  **Grievances of Indian Rulers:** The text states that 'nawabs and rajas had seen their power erode,' losing 'authority and honour,' with 'freedom of the rulers reduced,' 'armed forces disbanded,' and 'revenues and territories taken away.' Examples include the Company turning down Rani Lakshmibai's request to recognize her adopted son as heir and Nana Saheb's plea for his father's pension. Furthermore, the Company planned to end the Mughal dynasty, removing the king's name from coins and declaring Bahadur Shah Zafar as the last Mughal king.\n2.  **Grievances of Peasants:** The text highlights that 'peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection.' This led to many failing to repay loans and 'gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations.'\n3.  **Grievances of Sepoys:** Sepoys were 'unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service.' Crucially, 'new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs,' such as the refusal to go to Burma by sea route in 1824 and the 1856 law requiring overseas service.

Peasants and zamindars were discontented due to high taxes, rigid revenue collection methods, and the loss of their ancestral lands. Sepoys were unhappy with their pay, allowances, and service conditions, and new rules often violated their religious beliefs, such as the requirement for overseas service. Additionally, many Indians perceived British social reforms, including those promoting English education and Christian missionary activities, as an attempt to destroy their religion, social customs, and traditional way of life."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.9.5", "8.5.1", "7.6.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain. As the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \u201cThey are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others.\u201d \nThe Vaishnava poet-saints of Maharashtra such as Jnaneshwar, Namadeva, Eknath and Tukaram were devotees of lord Vitthala. Devotion around lord Vitthala gave rise to the Varkari sect which lay emphasis on an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur. The cult of Vitthala emerged as a powerful mode of devotion and was very popular amongst the people. \nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant Tukaram: He who identifies with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart He treats A slave As his own son Says Tuka I won\u2019t be tired to repeat again Such a man Is God In person. Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela\u2019s son: You made us low caste, Why don\u2019t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life \u2013 left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this. You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha\u2019s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou may have seen people perform rituals of worship, or singing bhajans, kirtans or qawwalis, or even repeating the name of God in silence, and noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations. They were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nSome towns like Ahmedabad (Gujarat) went on to become major commercial cities but others like Thanjavur shrank in size and importance over the centuries. Murshidabad (West Bengal) on the banks of the Bhagirathi, which rose to prominence as a centre for silks and became the capital of Bengal in 1704, declined in the course of the century as the weavers faced competition from cheap mill-made cloth from England. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere were many kinds of traders. These included the Banjaras (see also Chapter 7). Several traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors who bought horses. \nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards \u2013 the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. \nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China. \nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive. This eventually drew European traders to India. We will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns. \nWith its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in present-day Afghanistan) became politically and commercially important from the sixteenth century onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was primarily carried on through this route. In the seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum in those days. Camels carried dried fruits, dates, carpets, silks and even fresh fruits from Kabul to the subcontinent and elsewhere. Slaves were also brought here for sale. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for tribal groups to rebel in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and what were the specific political objectives of the Birsa Munda movement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states in the 'A Closer Look' section that tribal groups rebelled against 'changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders.'

He felt that just as a father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the teachings of the Buddha (Chapter 7). \nThere were a number of problems that troubled him. People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Animals were sacrificed. Slaves and servants were ill treated. Besides, there were quarrels in families and amongst neighbours. Ashoka felt it was his duty to solve these problems. So, he appointed officials, known as the dhamma mahamatta who went from place to place teaching people about dhamma. Besides, Ashoka got his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars, instructing his officials to read his message to those who could not read it themselves. \nAshoka also sent messengers to spread ideas about dhamma to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece and Sri Lanka. Try and identify these on Map 6, pages 84-85. He built roads, dug wells, and built rest houses. Besides, he arranged for medical treatment for both human beings and animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTake a look at Maps 1 and 2. Map 1 was made in 1154 CE by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi. The section reproduced here is a detail of the Indian subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The two maps are quite different even though they are of the same area. In al-Idrisi\u2019s map, south India is where we would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the island at the top. Place-names are marked in Arabic, and there are some well-known names like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (spelt in the map as Qanauj). Map 2 was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during which time information about the subcontinent had changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly detailed. This map was used by European sailors and merchants on their voyages (see Chapter 6). \nEqually important is the fact that the science of cartography differed in the two periods. When historians read documents, maps and texts from the past they have to be sensitive to the different historical backgrounds \u2013 the contexts \u2013 in which information about the past was produced. \nCartographer - A person who makes maps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe kings and kingdoms you have been reading about could not have existed without the support of flourishing villages. While new tools and the system of transplantation (Chapter 6) increased production, irrigation was also used. Irrigation works that were built during this time included canals, wells, tanks, and artificial lakes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After \n\n In March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors emboldened the indigo ryots to launch the \"Blue Rebellion\" in 1859, and what were the immediate outcomes of this revolt?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text section titled \"The 'Blue Rebellion' and After\" explicitly details the reasons behind the indigo ryots' rebellion and its immediate consequences.

If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nQazi \u2013 A judge \n Mufti \u2013 A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer \n Impeachment \u2013 A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons \n Dharmashastras \u2013 Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 BCE onwards \n Sawar \u2013 Men on horses \n Musket \u2013 A heavy gun used by infantry soldiers \n Matchlock \u2013 An early type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match \nSetting up a New Administration \n\n Warren Hastings (Governor-General from 1773 to 1785) was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts \u2013 a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat ). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors. \nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta. \nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. His office \u2013 the Collectorate \u2013 became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. \nThe Company army \n Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. \nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry requirements of the Company\u2019s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of the Company\u2019s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century the British began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nEmperors need more resources than kings because empires are larger than kingdoms, and need to be protected by big armies.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Magadha on Map 4 (page 57). Magadha became the most important mahajanapada in about two hundred years. Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies (c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest, could be captured and trained for the army. Forests also provided wood for building houses, carts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore mines in the region that could be tapped to make strong tools and weapons. \nMagadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible means to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma Nanda was another important ruler. He extended his control up to the north-west part of the subcontinent. Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in Bihar was the capital of Magadha for several years. Later the capital was shifted to Pataliputra (present-day Patna). \nMore than 2300 years ago, a ruler named Alexander, who lived in Macedonia in Europe, wanted to become a world conqueror. Of course, he didn\u2019t conquer the world, but did conquer parts of Egypt and West Asia, and came to the Indian subcontinent, reaching up to the banks of the Beas. When he wanted to march further eastwards, his soldiers refused.

They moved if they \"had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources.\" They also followed \"animals [that] move from place to place\" and moved seasonally because \"plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons.\" Furthermore, the need for \"water to survive\" from seasonal rivers and lakes during dry seasons compelled them to move. This clearly shows how natural resources (food, water) and environmental conditions (seasonality, animal movement) dictated their nomadic lifestyle.\n2.  **Magadha:** The second section explains how Magadha's natural resources and environment contributed to its power. \"Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha,\" which was important for \"transport, water supplies (c) making the land fertile.\" \"Parts of Magadha were forested,\" providing \"Elephants\" for the army and \"wood for building houses, carts and chariots.\" Additionally, \"iron ore mines in the region\" could be used to make \"strong tools and weapons.\" These resources directly supported its military, infrastructure, and agriculture, enabling its rise as a powerful mahajanapada.\n\nAnswer: Natural resources and environmental conditions shaped hunter-gatherer lifestyles by providing diverse plant and animal food sources, but also necessitated their movement due to resource depletion, animal migration, seasonal plant availability, and the need for water from seasonal sources. For Magadha, rivers provided transport, water, and fertile land, forests supplied elephants for the army and wood for construction, and iron ore mines offered materials for strong tools and weapons, all of which were crucial for its rise to power."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.2.1", "6.6.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum Zinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in November 1862. \nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the rebellion died down after that. People continued to resist and battle the British. The British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. Lucknow was taken in March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate awaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, chose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on all sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India and continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of many tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried and killed in April 1859. \nJust as victories against the British had earlier encouraged rebellion, the defeat of rebel forces encouraged desertions. The British also tried their best to win back the loyalty of the people. They announced rewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British, and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied.

Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly.

Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory.

The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIf you plant a seed, you will notice that it takes some time to grow.

And then, the grain had to be used carefully. \nAs grain had to be stored for both food and seed, people had to think of ways of storing it.

The Mahanavami festival was also crucial, involving the king receiving guests, tribute, and watching dance, music, and wrestling performances. Hampi also had significant commercial activities. The Puranas, containing stories about gods, goddesses, worship, world creation, and kings, were written in simple Sanskrit verse to be heard by everyone, including women and shudras, and were recited by priests in temples. Similarly, the Sanskrit epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana, were popular old stories written down to narrate tales of war (Kauravas and Pandavas) and a prince's quest (Rama), intended for a broad audience."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.8", "6.11.1", "6.12.7", "6.3.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Places where stone was found and where people made tools are known as factory sites. \nHow do we know where these factories were? Usually, we find blocks of stone, tools that were made and perhaps discarded because they were not perfect, and chips of waste stone left behind at these sites. Sometimes, people lived here for longer spells of time. These sites are called habitation-cum-factory sites. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nArvind was supposed to be acting as Samudragupta, a famous ruler of a dynasty known as the Guptas. We know about Samudragupta from a long inscription, inscribed on the Ashokan pillar at Allahabad. It was composed as a Kavya by Harishena, who was a poet and a minister at the court of Samudragupta. \nThis inscription is of a special kind known as a prashasti, a Sanskrit word, meaning \u2018in praise of\u2019. While prashastis were composed for some of the rulers you read about in Chapter 10, such as Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni, they became far more important from the time of the Guptas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBABUR 1526-1530 : 1526 \u2013 defeated Ibrahim Lodi and his Afghan supporters at Panipat. 1527 \u2013 defeated Rana Sanga, Rajput rulers and allies at Khanua. 1528 \u2013 defeated the Rajputs at Chanderi; Established control over Agra and Delhi before his death. \nHUMAYUN 1530-1540, 1555-1556 : (1) Humayun divided his inheritance according to the will of his father. His brothers were each given a province. The ambitions of his brother Mirza Kamran weakened Humayun\u2019s cause against Afghan competitors. Sher Khan defeated Humayun at Chausa (1539) and Kanauj (1540), forcing him to flee to Iran. (2) In Iran Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah. He recaptured Delhi in 1555 but died the next year after an accident in this building. \nAKBAR 1556-1605 : Akbar was 13 years old when he became emperor. His reign can be divided into three periods. (1) 1556-1570 \u2013 Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed. Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan, rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir\u2019s wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful. \nShah Jahan 1627-1658 : Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632 Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan\u2019s sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra. \nAurangzeb 1658-1707 : (1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas. His death was followed by a succession conflict amongst his sons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Which Mughal emperors faced rebellions from their sons, and what was the outcome for Prince Salim and Prince Khurram regarding their succession?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction. Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe city of Dholavira was located on Khadir Beyt (also spelled as Bet) in the Rann of Kutch, where there was fresh water and fertile soil. Unlike some of the other Harappan cities, which were divided into two parts, Dholavira was divided into three parts, and each part was surrounded with massive stone walls, with entrances through gateways. There was also a large open area in the settlement, where public ceremonies could be held. Other finds include large letters of the Harappan script that were carved out of white stone and perhaps inlaid in wood. This is a unique find as generally Harappan writing has been found on small objects such as seals. \nThe city of Lothal stood beside a tributary of the Sabarmati, in Gujarat, close to the Gulf of Khambat. It was situated near areas where raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available. This was an important centre for making objects out of stone, shell and metal. There was also a store house in the city. Many seals and sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were found in this storehouse. \nA building that was found here was probably a workshop for making beads: pieces of stone, half made beads, tools for bead making, and finished beads have all been found here. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe have seen that the earliest people hunted, gathered plant produce, made stone tools, and painted on cave walls. Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Error generating question"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: Error generating CoT\n\nAnswer: Error generating answer"}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.8", "7.5.2", "7.3.3", "6.2.9"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full of learned people, including Kalidasa the poet, and Aryabhata the astronomer, about whom you will read more in Chapter 12. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nArchaeologists have found seeds of wheat, barley, rice, pulses, millets, peas and sesame. Bones of a number of animals, many bearing cut marks that show they may have been used as food, have also been found. These include cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, dog, horse, ass, pig, sambhar, spotted deer, blackbuck, antelope, hare, and mongoose, besides birds, crocodile, turtle, crab and fish. There is evidence that fruits such as ber, amla, jamun, dates and a variety of berries were collected. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe often take the use of iron for granted today. Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have given lengthy names for the time that we are studying. They call the earliest period the Palaeolithic. This comes from two Greek words, \u2018palaeo\u2019, meaning old, and \u2018lithos\u2019, meaning stone. The name points to the importance of finds of stone tools. The Palaeolithic period extends from 2 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago. This long stretch of time is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This long span of time covers 99% of human history. \nThe period when we find environmental changes, beginning about 12,000 years ago till about 10,000 years ago is called the Mesolithic (middle stone). Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are called microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or wood to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older varieties of tools continued to be in use. \nThe next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, what were the primary materials used for tools and objects during the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Harappan periods, and when did the use of iron begin in the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section states that the Palaeolithic period is named for the importance of 'finds of stone tools'.

The only time they stayed in one place was during the rainy season, when it was very difficult to travel. Then, their supporters built temporary shelters for them in gardens, or they lived in natural caves in hilly areas. \nAs time went on, many supporters of the monks and nuns, and they themselves, felt the need for more permanent shelters and so monasteries were built. These were known as viharas. The earliest viharas were made of wood, and then of brick. Some were even in caves that were dug out in hills, especially in western India. \nVery often, the land on which the vihara was built was donated by a rich merchant or a landowner, or the king. The local people came with gifts of food, clothing and medicines for the monks and nuns. In return, they taught the people. Over the centuries, Buddhism spread to many parts of the subcontinent and beyond. You will learn more about this in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe organisation of the Sikhs into a political community during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 8) helped in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda Bahadur\u2019s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. \nUnder a number of able leaders in the eighteenth century, the Sikhs organized themselves into a number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. Their combined forces were known as the grand army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as \u201cresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)\u201d. A system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. \nGuru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega khalsa). Their well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the same inscription as the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur. \nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were divided under different rulers. One of them, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and established his capital at Lahore in 1799. \nTowards the end of the 17th century a powerful state started emerging in the Deccan under the leadership of Shivaji which finally led to the establishment of the Maratha state. Shivaji was born to Shahji and Jija Bai at Shivneri in 1630. Under the guidance of his mother and his guardian Dada Konddev, Shivaji embarked on a career of conquest at a young age. The occupation of Javli made him the undisputed leader of the Mavala highlands which paved the way for further expansion. His exploits against the forces of Bijapur and the Mughals made him a legendary figure. He often resorted to guerrilla warfare against his opponents. By introducing an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi he laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state. \nThe Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasantpastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji\u2019s death, effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji\u2019s successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom. \nBaji Rao I, also known as Baji Rao Ballal was the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath. He was a great Maratha general who is credited to have expanded the Maratha kingdom beyond the Vindhyas and is known for his military campaigns against Malwa, Bundelkhand, Gujarat and the Portugese. \nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very successful military organisation. Their success lay in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed. \nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region. \nChauth : 25 per cent of the land revenue claimed by zamindars. In the Deccan this was collected by the Marathas. Sardeshmukhi : 9-10 per cent of the land revenue paid to the head revenue collector in the Deccan. \nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south (see Map 1). These were not formally included in the Maratha empire, but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, but it came at a price. These military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well. Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under Sindhia\u2019s patronage and Indore under Holkar\u2019s. By all accounts these cities were large and prosperous and functioned as important commercial and cultural centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and Allahabad in the east. \nLike the other states the Jats consolidated their power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra. \nThe power of the Jats reached its zenith under Suraj Mal who consolidated the Jat state at Bharatpur (in present day Rajasthan) during 1756-1763. The areas under the political control of Suraj Mal broadly included parts of modern eastern Rajasthan, southern Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Suraj Mal built a number of forts and palaces and the famous Lohagarh fort in Bharatpur is regarded as one of the strongest forts built in this region. \nThe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, many of the city\u2019s notables took refuge there. His son Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to fight the Mughals. \nWhile the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first associated with royalty under Shah Jahan (see Figure 12 in Chapter 5 and Figure 12 in Chapter 9). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What architectural styles influenced the construction of the elaborate garden palace at Dig by the Jats, and to whom were these forms first associated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra.'

Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen that inscriptions are inscribed on hard surfaces. Many of these were inscribed several hundreds of years ago. All inscriptions contain both scripts and languages. Languages which were used, as well as scripts, have changed over time. So how do scholars understand what was inscribed? This can be done through a process known as decipherment \nOne of the most famous stories of decipherment comes from Egypt, a country in north Africa where there were kings and queens about 5000 years ago. \nRosetta is a town on the north coast of Egypt, and here an inscribed stone was found, which contained inscriptions in three different languages and scripts (Greek, and two forms of Egyptian). Scholars who could read Greek figured out that the names of kings and queens were enclosed in a little frame, called a cartouche. They then placed the Greek and the Egyptian signs side by side, and identified the sounds for which the Egyptian letters stood. As you can see, a lion stood for L, and a bird for A. Once they knew what the letters stood for, they could read other inscriptions as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here. At some sites, a large number of tools, used for all sorts of activities, were found. These were probably habitation-cum factory sites. In some of the other, smaller sites, there is evidence to suggest that tools were made. Some of the sites were close to springs. Most tools were made from limestone, which was locally available \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What architectural styles and technological advancements were developed to facilitate the construction of large and elaborate structures like temples and stepwells, and how did these innovations manifest in specific historical examples?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text details several architectural styles and technological advancements. The 'trabeate' or 'corbelled' style, which involved placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns for roofs, doors, and windows, was used between the seventh and tenth centuries and applied to temples, mosques, tombs, and baolis between the eighth and thirteenth centuries (Section 3). From the twelfth century, two major developments emerged: the 'arcuate' architectural form, where arches carried the weight of the superstructure above doors and windows, and the increasing use of high-quality 'limestone cement,' which, when mixed with stone chips, hardened into concrete, making construction faster and easier (Section 3). These innovations are exemplified by specific structures: the Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur required architects to build an inclined path over 4 km long to roll a 90-tonne stone to the top of its shikhara, as manual lifting was impossible (Section 3). The Kandariya Mahadeva temple, built in 999, showcases an elaborate design with an ornamented gateway, a main hall (mahamandapa), and a main shrine (garbhagriha), adorned with intricately carved sculptures (Section 3). Lastly, the Raniji ki baori, constructed in 1699 C.E., is highlighted as the largest of its kind and known for its architectural beauty, illustrating the application of these skills to large stepwells (Section 3).\n\nAnswer: To facilitate the construction of large and elaborate structures, architects developed the 'trabeate' or 'corbelled' style, which involved placing horizontal beams across vertical columns. From the twelfth century, the 'arcuate' style emerged, utilizing arches to support superstructures, alongside the adoption of high-quality limestone cement that hardened into concrete, making construction easier and faster. These innovations are evident in the Rajarajeshvara temple, where an inclined path was engineered to position a 90-tonne stone on its shikhara.

Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors led to the emergence of jatis as the primary basis for organizing society, and how were various new groups, including specialized artisans and tribal communities, incorporated into this evolving social structure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that jatis emerged because 'As the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required.'

The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today.

A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFrom the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns. These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain.

There were also dedicated streets for various artisans (e.g., potters, smiths). Traders, both local and those travelling from town to town, facilitated the exchange of local articles and products from distant places like horses, salt, and spices. Samantas or zamindars built fortified palaces and levied taxes on traders, artisans, and articles of trade.

(1) 1556-1570 \u2013 Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed. Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan, rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir\u2019s wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful. \nShah Jahan 1627-1658 : Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632 Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan\u2019s sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra. \nAurangzeb 1658-1707 : (1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas. His death was followed by a succession conflict amongst his sons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAshoka\u2019s dhamma did not involve worship of a god, or performance of a sacrifice. He felt that just as a father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the teachings of the Buddha (Chapter 7). \nThere were a number of problems that troubled him. People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Animals were sacrificed. Slaves and servants were ill treated. Besides, there were quarrels in families and amongst neighbours. Ashoka felt it was his duty to solve these problems. So, he appointed officials, known as the dhamma mahamatta who went from place to place teaching people about dhamma. Besides, Ashoka got his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars, instructing his officials to read his message to those who could not read it themselves. \nAshoka also sent messengers to spread ideas about dhamma to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece and Sri Lanka. Try and identify these on Map 6, pages 84-85. He built roads, dug wells, and built rest houses. Besides, he arranged for medical treatment for both human beings and animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made. These developments took place simultaneously, i.e. at the same time. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of the book. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found traces of huts or houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, which were dug into the ground, with steps leading into them. These may have provided shelter in cold weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking hearths both inside and outside the huts, which suggests that, depending on the weather, people could cook food either indoors or outdoors. \nStone tools have been found from many sites as well. Many of these are different from the earlier Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles used for grinding grain and other plant produce. Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain even today, several thousand years later. At the same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued to be made and used, and remember, some tools were also made of bone. \nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been found. These were sometimes decorated, and were used for storing things. People began using pots for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat and lentils that now became an important part of the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using different kinds of materials, for example cotton, that could now be grown. \nDid things change everywhere and all at once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women still continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere people adopted farming and herding slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, in some cases people tried to combine these activities, doing different things during different seasons.imals \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary methods employed by Emperor Ashoka to govern his subjects and spread his ideology, and how did these methods differ from the typical actions of the Mughal emperors described?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The 'Ashoka\u2019s dhamma' section outlines Emperor Ashoka's methods for governance and ideological spread.

He also had his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars and sent messengers to spread these ideas to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece, and Sri Lanka. Furthermore, Ashoka engaged in public welfare by building roads, digging wells, building rest houses, and arranging medical treatment for both human beings and animals, all aimed at solving problems like conflict, animal sacrifice, and ill-treatment.\n\nIn contrast, the 'Mughal Emperors' section primarily describes the actions of rulers like Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb through military means.

The text consistently highlights their expansionist and power-consolidating military endeavors.\n\nThus, Ashoka's methods focused on moral instruction, social welfare, and the peaceful propagation of an ideology, whereas the Mughal emperors' actions were predominantly characterized by military conquest, territorial expansion, and the forceful suppression of opposition.\n\nAnswer: Emperor Ashoka's primary methods involved moral instruction, social welfare, and the peaceful propagation of his dhamma through appointed officials ('dhamma mahamatta'), inscribed messages on rocks and pillars, and messengers sent to other lands.

However, in spite of such claims, they often shared power with their samantas as well as with associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas. \nIn each of these states, resources were obtained from the producers \u2013 that is, peasants, cattle-keepers, artisans \u2013 who were often persuaded or compelled to surrender part of what they produced. Sometimes these were claimed as \u201crent\u201d due to a lord who asserted that he owned the land. Revenue was also collected from traders. \nThe inscriptions of the Cholas who ruled in Tamil Nadu refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds of taxes. The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti, taken not in cash but in the form of forced labour, and kadamai, or land revenue. There were also taxes on thatching the house, the use of a ladder to climb palm trees, a cess on succession to family property, etc. \nThese resources were used to finance the king\u2019s establishment, as well as for the construction of temples and forts. They were also used to fight wars, which were in turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes. \nThe functionaries for collecting revenue were generally recruited from influential families, and positions were often hereditary. This was true about the army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the king held these positions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Ajanta on Map 7 (page 113). This is a place where several caves were hollowed out of the hills over centuries. Most of these were monasteries for Buddhist monks, and some of them were decorated with paintings. Here are some examples. As the caves are dark inside, most of these paintings were done in the light of torches. The colours, which are vivid even after 1500 years, were made of plants and minerals. The artists who created these splendid works of art remain unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nCaste and Social Reform \n\n Some of the social reformers we have been discussing also criticised caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy translated an old Buddhist text that was critical of caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of Bhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes. In Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in 1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these reformers and members of reform associations were people of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these reformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch, in an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in their lives. \nThere were also others who questioned the injustices of the caste social order. During the course of the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries began setting up schools for tribal groups and \u201clower\u201d-caste children. These children were thus equipped with some resources to make their way into a changing world. \nAt the same time, the poor began leaving their villages to look for jobs that were opening up in the cities. There was work in the factories that were coming up, and jobs in municipalities. You have read about the expansion of cities in Chapter 6. Think of the new demands of labour this created. Drains had to be dug, roads laid, buildings constructed, and cities cleaned. This required coolies, diggers, carriers, bricklayers, sewage cleaners, sweepers, palanquin bearers, rickshaw pullers. Where did this labour come from? The poor from the villages and small towns, many of them from low castes, began moving to the cities where there was a new demand for labour. Some also went to work in plantations in Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad and Indonesia. Work in the new locations was often very hard. But the poor, the people from low castes, saw this as an opportunity to get away from the oppressive hold that upper-caste landowners exercised over their lives and the daily humiliation they suffered. \nThere were other jobs too. The army, for instance, offered opportunities. A number of Mahar people, who were regarded as untouchable, found jobs in the Mahar Regiment. The father of B.R. Ambedkar, the leader of the Dalit movement, taught at an army school. \nDemands for equality and justice \n Gradually, by the second half of the nineteenth century, people from within the Non-Brahman castes began organising movements against caste discrimination, and demanded social equality and justice. \nThe Satnami movement in Central India was founded by Ghasidas who worked among the leatherworkers and organised a movement to improve their social status. In eastern Bengal, Haridas Thakur\u2019s Matua sect worked among Chandala cultivators. Haridas questioned Brahmanical texts that supported the caste system. In what is present-day Kerala, a guru from Ezhava caste, Shri Narayana Guru, proclaimed the ideals of unity for his people. He argued against treating people unequally on the basis of caste differences. According to him, all humankind belonged to the same caste. One of his famous statements was: \u201coru jati, oru matam, oru daivam manushyanu\u201d (one caste, one religion, one god for humankind). \nAll these sects were founded by leaders who came from Non-Brahman castes and worked amongst them. They tried to change those habits and practices which provoked the contempt of dominant castes. They tried to create a sense of self-esteem among the subordinate castes. \nGulamgiri \n One of the most vocal amongst the \u201clow-caste\u201d leaders was Jyotirao Phule. Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up by Christian missionaries. On growing up he developed his own ideas about the injustices of caste society. He set out to attack the Brahmans\u2019 claim that they were superior to others, since they were Aryans. Phule argued that the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside the subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true children of the country \u2013 those who had lived here from before the coming of the Aryans. As the Aryans established their dominance, they began looking at the defeated population as inferior, as low-caste people. According to Phule, the \u201cupper\u201d castes had no right to their land and power: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people, the so-called low castes. \nPhule claimed that before Aryan rule there existed a golden age when warrior-peasants tilled the land and ruled the Maratha countryside in just and fair ways. He proposed that Shudras (labouring castes) and Ati Shudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste discrimination. The Satyashodhak Samaj, an association Phule founded, propagated caste equality. \nIn 1873, Phule wrote a book named Gulamgiri, meaning slavery. Some ten years before this, the American Civil War had been fought, leading to the end of slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves, thus establishing a link between the conditions of the \u201clower\u201d castes in India and the black slaves in America. \nAs this example shows, Phule extended his criticism of the caste system to argue against all forms of inequality. He was concerned about the plight of \u201cupper\u201d-caste women, the miseries of the labourer, and the humiliation of the \u201clow\u201d castes. This movement for caste reform was continued in the twentieth century by other great dalit leaders like Dr B.R. Ambedkar in western India and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in the south. \nWho could enter temples? \n Ambedkar was born into a Mahar family. As a child he experienced what caste prejudice meant in everyday life. In school he was forced to sit outside the classroom on the ground, and was not allowed to drink water from taps that upper -caste children used. After finishing school, he got a fellowship to go to the US for higher studies. On his return to India in 1919, he wrote extensively about \u201cupper\u201d- caste power in contemporary society. \nIn 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry movement, in which his Mahar caste followers participated. Brahman priests were outraged when the Dalits used water from the temple tank. Ambedkar led three such movements for temple entry between 1927 and 1935. His aim was to make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society. \nThe Non-Brahman movement \n In the early twentieth century, the non-Brahman movement started. The initiative came from those non-Brahman castes that had acquired access to education, wealth and influence. They argued that Brahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the north who had conquered southern lands from the original inhabitants of the region \u2013 the indigenous Dravidian races. They also challenged Brahmanical claims to power. \nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he was called, came from a middle-class family. Interestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early life and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully. Later, he became a member of the Congress, only to leave it in disgust when he found that at a feast organised by nationalists, seating arrangements followed caste distinctions \u2013 that is, the lower castes were made to sit at a distance from the upper castes. Convinced that untouchables had to fight for their dignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement. He argued that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt that all religious authorities saw social divisions and inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to free themselves, therefore, from all religions in order to achieve social equality. \nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures, especially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver, and the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said that these texts had been used to establish the authority of Brahmans over lower castes and the domination of men over women. \nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The forceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-caste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self-criticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. But orthodox Hindu society also reacted by founding Sanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal in the north, and associations like the Brahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these associations was to uphold caste distinctions as a cornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was sanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over caste continued beyond the colonial period and are still going on in our own times. \nOrganising for reform \n The Brahmo Samaj \n The Brahmo Samaj, formed in 1830, prohibited all forms of idolatry and sacrifice, believed in the Upanishads, and forbade its members from criticising other religious practices. It critically drew upon the ideals of religions \u2013 especially of Hinduism and Christianity \u2013 looking at their negative and positive dimensions. \nDerozio and Young Bengal \n Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the 1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all authority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked tradition and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned for the freedom of thought and expression. \nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda \n Named after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s guru, the Ramakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service and selfless action. \nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra Nath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his well founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world. After hearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the New York Herald reported, \u201cWe feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation\u201d. Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in modern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the Vedanta philosophy on a global scale. But his mission was not simply to talk of religion. He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery of his country men. He firmly believed that any reform could become successful only by uplifting the condition of the masses. Therefore, his clarion call to the people of India was to rise above the narrow confines of their \u2018religion of the kitchen\u2019 and come together in the service of the nation. By sending out this call he made a signal contribution to the nascent nationalism of India. His sense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception. He was convinced that many of the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the nations of the world come together on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth was to unite on the basis of a common spiritual heritage. In this exhortation he became truly \u2018the symbol of a new spirit and a source of strength for the future\u2019. \nThe Prarthana Samaj \n Established in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, abolish child marriage, encourage the education of women, and end the ban on widow remarriage. Its religious meetings drew upon Hindu, Buddhist and Christian texts. \nThe Veda Samaj \n Established in Madras (Chennai) in 1864, the Veda Samaj was inspired by the Brahmo Samaj. It worked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women\u2019s education. Its members believed in one God. They condemned the superstitions and rituals of orthodox Hinduism. \nThe Aligarh Movement \n The Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, founded by Sayyid Ahmed Khan in 1875 at Aligarh, later became the Aligarh Muslim University. The institution offered modern education, including Western science, to Muslims. The Aligarh Movement, as it was known, had an enormous impact in the area of educational reform. \nThe Singh Sabha Movement \n Reform organisations of the Sikhs, the first Singh Sabhas were formed at Amritsar in 1873 and at Lahore in 1879. The Sabhas sought to rid Sikhism of superstitions, caste distinctions and practices seen by them as non-Sikh. They promoted education among the Sikhs, often combining modern instruction with Sikh teachings. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs traders journeyed to distant lands in caravans and ships, pilgrims often travelled with them. Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nFrom the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people. The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain. As the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \u201cThey are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others.\u201d \nThe Vaishnava poet-saints of Maharashtra such as Jnaneshwar, Namadeva, Eknath and Tukaram were devotees of lord Vitthala. Devotion around lord Vitthala gave rise to the Varkari sect which lay emphasis on an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur. The cult of Vitthala emerged as a powerful mode of devotion and was very popular amongst the people. \nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant Tukaram: He who identifies with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart He treats A slave As his own son Says Tuka I won\u2019t be tired to repeat again Such a man Is God In person. Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela\u2019s son: You made us low caste, Why don\u2019t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life \u2013 left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this. You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha\u2019s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the diverse approaches and key figures involved in challenging caste discrimination and promoting social equality, as described in the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details multiple strategies and individuals engaged in combating caste discrimination and advocating for social equality. \n\n1.  **Early Reformers and Organizations:** Rammohun Roy translated a Buddhist text critical of caste.

In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago.

They practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the administrative divisions of the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga and explain how Shah Jahan's urban planning in his capital cities utilized riverfront access."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Gond Administrative Divisions:** The first text section states that the administrative system of the Gond kingdoms, including Garha Katanga, was becoming centralised.

In the early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti noted: \u201che removed all the valuables ... The statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace ... and the golden images in the various monasteries \u2013 all these he seized.\u201d The blow to the pride of the Sinhalese ruler had to be avenged and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered his general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. The Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha. \nSimilarly in the early eleventh century, when the Chola king Rajendra I built a Shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated rulers. An incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas; an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the Palas of Bengal. \nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of Rajendra I. During his campaigns in the subcontinent he attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols. Sultan Mahmud was not a very important ruler at that time. But by destroying temples \u2013 especially the one at Somnath \u2013 he tried to win credit as a great hero of Islam. In the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago.

These indicate that people, perhaps belonging to the same family, were buried in the same place though not at the same time. The bodies of those who died later were brought into the grave through the portholes.

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe thousand years of history that we are exploring witnessed major developments in religious traditions. People\u2019s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective belief in a supernatural agency \u2013 religion \u2013 was often closely connected with the social and economic organisation of local communities. As the social worlds of these groups altered so too did their beliefs. \nIt was during this period that important changes occurred in what we call Hinduism today. These included the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty and the growing importance of Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society. Their knowledge of Sanskrit texts earned the Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant position was consolidated by the support of their patrons \u2013 new rulers searching for prestige. \nOne of the major developments of this period was the emergence of the idea of bhakti \u2013 of a loving, personal deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about this, and other traditions, in Chapter 8. \nThis was also the period when new religions appeared in the subcontinent. Merchants and migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the Quran as their holy book and accept the sovereignty of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard to social background. \nMany rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama \u2013 learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism, Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its followers. There were the Shia Muslims who believed that the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s son-in-law, Ali, was the legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and the Sunni Muslims who accepted the authority of the early leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and the succeeding Khalifas. There were other important differences between the various schools of law (Hanafi and Shafi\u2019i mainly in India), and in theology and mystic traditions. \nPatron - An influential, wealthy individual who supports another person \u2013 an artiste, a craftsperson, a learned man, or a noble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did rulers interact with religious traditions and structures, both in their construction and destruction, during the period following the Mauryan empire's collapse?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text indicates multiple ways rulers interacted with religious traditions and structures.

The section concludes that 'in the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers.' These details collectively describe the dual interaction of rulers with religious structures.\n\nAnswer: Rulers actively engaged with religious traditions and structures by constructing temples to demonstrate their devotion, power, and wealth, and by acting as patrons for new religions like Islam and their learned figures. Conversely, they frequently targeted and looted the temples and idols of defeated rival kingdoms during warfare, using these acts to display their political might and military success."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.8", "6.8.9", "8.10.1", "7.5.4", "7.1.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was in no other place. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about the past depending upon the period of their study and the nature of their investigation. Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later. The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in large library collections. \nArchive - A place where documents and manuscripts are stored. Today all national and state governments have archives where they keep all their old official records and transactions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What significant challenges did historians encounter when utilizing textual records and manuscripts from the period between 700 and 1750, and what were the primary reasons for these difficulties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the third section explicitly details the challenges historians faced with textual records and manuscripts. It states that while paper became cheaper and more available, and textual records increased, they were 'difficult to use'. The primary reasons cited are: 1. The absence of a printing press meant 'scribes copied manuscripts by hand'. 2. During this copying process, scribes 'introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there', which accumulated over centuries, leading to 'manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another'. 3.

Additionally, authors sometimes 'revised their chronicles at different times', as exemplified by Ziyauddin Barani, whose earlier version remained unknown for a long time.\n\nAnswer: Historians faced significant challenges with textual records and manuscripts from 700 to 1750 primarily because there was no printing press, requiring scribes to copy texts by hand. This manual copying led to the introduction of small, cumulative changes over time, resulting in substantially different versions of the same text. Furthermore, historians rarely had access to original manuscripts, relying instead on these varied copies, and authors occasionally revised their own chronicles at different times, adding to the complexity of historical interpretation."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.1", "7.8.8", "7.1.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSomewhat before the time of the Mauryan empire, about 2400 years ago, emperors in China began building the Great Wall. \nIt was meant to protect the northern frontier of the empire from pastoral people. Additions to the wall were made over a period of 2000 years because the frontiers of the empire kept shifting. The wall is about 6400 km long, and is made of stone and brick, with a road along the top. Several thousand people worked to build the wall. There are watch towers all along, at distances of about 100-200 m. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nSeals may have been used to stamp bags or packets containing goods that were sent from one place to another. After a bag was closed or tied, a layer of wet clay was applied on the knot, and the seal was pressed on it. The impression of the seal is known as a sealing. If the sealing was intact, one could be sure that the goods had arrived safely. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nSovereign \u2013 The capacity to act independently without outside interference. \n Publicist \u2013 Someone who publicises an idea by circulating information, writing reports, speaking at meetings. \n Repeal \u2013 To undo law; to officially end the validity of something such as a law. \n Revolutionary violence - The use of violence to make a radical change within society. \n Council \u2013 An appointed or elected body of people with an administrative, advisory or representative function. \n \n9 The Making of the National Movement: 1870s--1947 \n\n In the previous chapters we have looked at: \u00a2 The British conquest of territories, and takeover of kingdoms \u00a2 Introduction of new laws and administrative institutions \u00a2 Changes in the lives of peasants and tribals \u00a2 Educational changes in the nineteenth century \u00a2 Debates regarding the condition of women \u00a2 Challenges to the caste system \u00a2 Social and religious reform \u00a2 The revolt of 1857 and its aftermath \u00a2 The decline of crafts and growth of industries On the basis of what you have read about these issues, do you think Indians were discontented with British rule? If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the initial objectives and methods of the Indian National Congress, and how did these evolve with the rise of more radical leadership by the 1890s, including key figures and their defining slogans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the section 'The Making of the National Movement: 1870s--1947' details the objectives and methods of the Indian National Congress.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction. Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nQazi \u2013 A judge \n Mufti \u2013 A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer \n Impeachment \u2013 A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons \n Dharmashastras \u2013 Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 BCE onwards \n Sawar \u2013 Men on horses \n Musket \u2013 A heavy gun used by infantry soldiers \n Matchlock \u2013 An early type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match \nSetting up a New Administration \n\n Warren Hastings (Governor-General from 1773 to 1785) was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts \u2013 a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat ). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors. \nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta. \nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. His office \u2013 the Collectorate \u2013 became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. \nThe Company army \n Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. \nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry requirements of the Company\u2019s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of the Company\u2019s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century the British began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAround the time that the Buddha was preaching and perhaps a little earlier, other thinkers also tried to find answers to difficult questions. Some of them wanted to know about life after death, others wanted to know why sacrifices should be performed. Many of these thinkers felt that there was something permanent in the universe that would last even after death. They described this as the atman or the individual soul and the brahman or the universal soul. They believed that ultimately, both the atman and the brahman were one. \nMany of their ideas were recorded in the Upanishads. These were part of the later Vedic texts. Upanishad literally means \u2018approaching and sitting near\u2019 and the texts contain conversations between teachers and students. Often, ideas were presented through simple dialogues. \nMost Upanishadic thinkers were men, especially brahmins and rajas. Occasionally, there is mention of women thinkers, such as Gargi, who was famous for her learning, and participated in debates held in royal courts. Poor people rarely took part in these discussions. One famous exception was Satyakama Jabala, who was named after his mother, the slave woman Jabali. He had a deep desire to learn about reality, was accepted as a student by a brahmin teacher named Gautama, and became one of the best-known thinkers of the time. Many of the ideas of the Upanishads were later developed by the famous thinker Shankaracharya, about whom you will read in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the administrative reforms introduced by Warren Hastings and explain how changes in the Company's military policy, along with specific rumors, contributed to sepoy unrest."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought will first identify Warren Hastings' administrative reforms from the 'Setting up a New Administration' section.

From 1772, each district had a criminal court (faujdari adalat) and a civil court (diwani adalat). European district collectors presided over civil courts, interpreting Indian laws with the help of Maulvis and Hindu pandits. Criminal courts were under a qazi and a mufti but supervised by collectors. To achieve uniformity, a digest of Hindu laws was compiled by eleven pandits (translated by N.B. Halhed) in 1775, and a code of Muslim laws was compiled by 1778. The Regulating Act of 1773 established a new Supreme Court and a court of appeal (Sadar Nizamat Adalat) in Calcutta. The Collector's main job was to collect revenue and taxes, and maintain law and order.\n\n2.  **Changes in Company's Military Policy:** The 'Setting up a New Administration' section also details changes in the Company army. Unlike the Mughal army, which relied heavily on cavalry, the East India Company began recruiting peasants and training them as professional soldiers, forming the sepoy army. From the 1820s, as warfare technology changed (e.g., muskets and matchlocks), the Company's cavalry requirements declined, and infantry regiments became more important. The British started developing a uniform military culture, subjecting soldiers to European-style training, drill, and discipline, often ignoring caste and community feelings.\n\n3.  **Contribution to Sepoy Unrest (Rumors/Perceptions):** The 'Through the Eyes of the People' section provides direct accounts of sepoy unrest. \n    *   Vishnubhatt Godse's account mentions sepoys believing the English were determined to wipe out Hindu and Muslim religions, had made a list of eighty-four rules announced in Calcutta, and that kings refused to accept these rules, leading to plans for a 'war of religion.'\n    *   Subedar Sitaram Pande's memoirs state that the seizing of Oudh filled sepoys with distrust. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi incited mutiny by telling 'ten thousand lies' about foreign treachery and the aim to restore the Emperor of Delhi. A crucial rumor was that the cartridges for the new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, which would defile both Mahommedans and Hindus. Interested parties quickly spread the idea that the English aimed to convert them all to Christians through this cartridge.\n\nAnswer: Warren Hastings introduced significant administrative reforms, particularly in the sphere of justice. From 1772, a new system established two courts per district: a civil court (diwani adalat) presided over by European district collectors, who were aided by Maulvis and Hindu pandits, and a criminal court (faujdari adalat) under a qazi and a mufti, but supervised by collectors. To ensure uniformity, a digest of Hindu laws was compiled in 1775 (translated by N.B. Halhed), and a code of Muslim laws by 1778. The Regulating Act of 1773 also established a new Supreme Court and a court of appeal, the Sadar Nizamat Adalat, in Calcutta. The Collector became the central figure, responsible for revenue collection and maintaining law and order.\n\nConcurrently, changes in the Company's military policy contributed to sepoy unrest. The Company transitioned from a cavalry-dominated force to a sepoy army by recruiting and training peasants as professional soldiers. From the 1820s, with new warfare technologies like muskets and matchlocks, infantry regiments gained prominence. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill, and discipline, often disregarding their caste and community feelings.\n\nThese military changes, coupled with specific rumors and perceptions, fueled deep distrust among sepoys. Vishnubhatt Godse's account notes sepoys believed the English intended to eradicate Hindu and Muslim religions through 'eighty-four rules,' leading kings to plan a 'war of religion.' Subedar Sitaram Pande's memoirs highlight that the seizure of Oudh instilled distrust. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi actively incited mutiny by spreading falsehoods about foreign treachery and the goal of restoring the Emperor of Delhi. Critically, a widespread rumor claimed the new rifle cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, which would defile both Mahommedans and Hindus. This was leveraged by 'interested parties' who claimed the English's ultimate aim was to convert them to Christianity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.5.2", "6.7.8", "8.2.4", "7.5.2", "6.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHindu The word \u2018Hindu\u2019, like the term \u2018India\u2019 is derived from the river Indus.

There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou may have noticed that each of these ruling dynasties was based in a specific region. At the same time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj. Because there were three \u201cparties\u201d in this longdrawn conflict, historians often describe it as the \u201ctripartite struggle\u201d. \nAs we will see (pp. 62-66), rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples. So, when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms, they often chose to target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich. You will read more about this in Chapter 5. \nOne of the best known of such rulers is Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. He ruled from 997 to 1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia, Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent. He raided the subcontinent almost every year \u2013 his targets were wealthy temples, including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni. \nSultan Mahmud was also interested in finding out more about the people he conquered, and entrusted a scholar named Al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent. This Arabic work, known as the Kitab ul-Hind, remains an important source for historians. He consulted Sanskrit scholars to prepare this account. \nOther kings who engaged in warfare included the Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They attempted to expand their control to the west and the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh. The best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very next year, in 1192. \nSultan - An Arabic term meaning ruler. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana \u2013 or \u201ccountry inhabited by Gonds\u201d. They practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nOstriches were found in India during the Palaeolithic period.

Later, some Zoroastrians migrated from Iran and settled down in the coastal towns of Gujarat and Maharashtra. They were the ancestors of today\u2019s Parsis. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThere are several ways of describing people \u2014 in terms of the work they do, the language they speak, the place they belong to, their family, their communities and cultural practices. Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. \nThere are two groups who are described in terms of their work \u2014 the priests, sometimes called brahmins, who performed various rituals, and the rajas. \nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be learning about later. They did not have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Generally, sons did not automatically succeed fathers as rajas. \nTwo words were used to describe the people or the community as a whole. One was the word jana, which we still use in Hindi and other languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 6. \nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name. So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and so on. \nSometimes, the people who composed the hymns described themselves as Aryas and called their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were women and men who were often captured in war. They were treated as the property of their owners, who could make them do whatever work they wanted. \nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of these. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIn the nineteenth century, the region that constitutes most of present-day Rajasthan, was called Rajputana by the British. While this may suggest that this was an area that was inhabited only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. There were (and are) several groups who identify themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and central India. And of course, there are several peoples other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan. \nThese cultural traditions were closely linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. From about the eighth century, most of the present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) was one such ruler. These rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow their example. Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories \u2013 which often depicted dramatic situations, and a range of strong emotions \u2013 loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger, etc. \nDid women find a place within these stories? Sometimes, they figure as the \u201ccause\u201d for conflicts, as men fought with one another to either \u201cwin\u201d or \u201cprotect\u201d women. Women are also depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death \u2013 there are stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay for it with their lives. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the fundamental teachings of Zoroaster, and how did Kabir's approach to religious practice contrast with the external rituals and traditions of his time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first extract Zoroaster's core teachings from the first text section. The text states: 'The basic teachings of Zoroaster are contained in the maxim \u201cGood thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.\u201d' It also mentions a verse from the Zend Avesta about 'strength and the rule of truth and good thinking, by means of which one shall create peace and tranquillity.'\n\nNext, I will identify Kabir's approach to religious practice and his stance on external rituals from the third text section. This section explicitly states: 'Kabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions.

These were Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. All three states were founded by members of the high Mughal nobility who had been governors of large provinces \u2013 Sa\u2018adat Khan (Awadh), Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad). All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both Asaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Sa\u2018adat Khan\u2019s zat was 6,000. \nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state (1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had already gained control over its political and financial administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the actual ruler of that region. \nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. \nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2). \nA description of the Nizam of Hyderabad\u2019s personal troopers in 1790: \u2026The Nizam has a swaree (sawari) of 400 elephants, several thousand of horsemen near his person who receive upwards 100 R(upees)s nominal pay (and) are extremely well mounted and richly caparisoned \nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire. Awadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. In other words, he was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh. \nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawab\u2019s court. He seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand. \nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past. \nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Like the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars. \nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenthcentury Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars. The close connection between the state and bankers \u2013 noticeable in Hyderabad and Awadh as well \u2013 was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756). During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous. \nIf we take a bird\u2019s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states. First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably. The third common feature in all these regional states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the three principal common characteristics shared by the newly formed states of Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad in the eighteenth century, particularly concerning their administrative systems and financial relationships?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly outlines 'three common features amongst these states' in its concluding section. \n1.

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBose and the INA \n A radical nationalist, with socialist leanings, Bose did not share Gandhiji\u2019s ideal of ahimsa, though he respected him as the \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d. In January 1941, he secretly left his Calcutta home, went to Singapore, via Germany, and raised the Azad Hind Fauj or the Indian National Army (INA). To free India from British control, in 1944, the INA tried to enter India through Imphal and Kohima but the campaign failed. The INA members were imprisoned and tried. People across the country, from all walks of life, participated in the movement against the INA trials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhile we can learn about the Gupta rulers from their inscriptions and coins, we can find out about some kings from biographies. Harshavardhana, who ruled nearly 1400 years ago, was one such ruler. His court poet, Banabhatta, wrote his biography, the Harshacharita, in Sanskrit. This gives us the genealogy of Harsha, and ends with his becoming king. Xuan Zang, about whom you read in Chapter 10, also spent a lot of time at Harsha\u2019s court and left a detailed account of what he saw. \nHarsha was not the eldest son of his father, but became king of Thanesar after both his father and elder brother died. His brother-in-law was the ruler of Kanauj (see Map 7) and he was killed by the ruler of Bengal. Harsha took over the kingdom of Kanauj, and then led an army against the ruler of Bengal. \nAlthough he was successful in the east, and conquered both Magadha and Bengal, he was not as successful elsewhere. He tried to cross the Narmada to march into the Deccan, but was stopped by a ruler belonging to the Chalukya dynasty, Pulakeshin II. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nUnlike taxes, which were collected on a regular basis, tribute was collected as and when it was possible from people who gave a variety of things, more or less willingly. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's pursuit of trade lead to its acquisition of the Diwani rights in Bengal, and what were the key consequences of this shift?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The East India Company's initial objective was to make profit through trade, buying goods cheaply and selling them at higher prices, as outlined by its charter from Queen Elizabeth I in 1800. This pursuit of trade led to intense competition with other European powers and, crucially, to conflicts with local rulers, such as the Nawabs of Bengal. The Nawabs resisted the Company's attempts to fortify settlements, expand trade, and avoid paying duties, which they claimed deprived the Bengal government of revenue and undermined their authority. This escalating conflict culminated in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, where the Company, under Robert Clive, secured its first major victory by defeating Sirajuddaulah with the help of Mir Jafar's betrayal. Following this, the Company attempted to control Bengal through puppet nawabs who would grant trade concessions and privileges. However, these puppet nawabs, like Mir Jafar and Mir Qasim, eventually protested the Company's increasing demands for money to finance its wars and other expenses. This difficulty in working with puppet rulers led Robert Clive to declare that the Company must become 'nawabs ourselves.' Consequently, in 1785, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. This acquisition of Diwani rights was a significant shift, as it allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal to finance its trade (purchasing cotton and silk textiles), maintain its troops, and cover the cost of building its fort and offices in Calcutta. This eliminated the previous necessity of importing gold and silver from Britain to buy goods.

The key consequences of this shift were that the Company could now use Bengal's vast revenue resources to finance its trade, maintain troops, and cover administrative costs, thereby stopping the outflow of gold and silver from Britain.

The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThis was also the time when the worship of certain deities, which became a central feature of later Hinduism, gained in importance. These deities included Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as Durga. \nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti, an idea that became very popular at this time. Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti. \nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is included in the Mahabharata (see Chapter 12). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna, his devotee and friend, to abandon all dharmas and take refuge in him, as only he can set Arjuna free from every evil. This form of worship gradually spread to different parts of the country. \nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasised devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices. \nAccording to this system of belief, if a devotee worships the chosen deity with a pure heart, the deity will appear in the form in which he or she may desire. So, the deity could be thought of as a human being, lion, tree or any other form. Once this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities. \nBecause the deities were special, these images of the deity were often placed within special homes, places that we describe as temples. You will learn more about these temples in Chapter 12. Bhakti inspired some of the best expressions in art \u2014 sculpture, poetry and architecture. \nBhakti Comes from the Sanskrit term bhaj meaning \u2018to divide or share.\u2019 This suggests an intimate, two-way relationship between the deity and the devotee. Bhakti is directed towards Bhagavat, which is often translated as god, but also means one who possesses and shares bhaga, literally good fortune or bliss. The devotee, known as the bhakta or the bhagavata, shares his or her chosen deity\u2019s bhaga. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were at least three different kinds of people living in most villages in the southern and northern parts of the subcontinent. In the Tamil region, large landowners were known as vellalar, ordinary ploughmen were known as uzhavar, and landless labourers, including slaves, were known as kadaisiyar and adimai. \nIn the northern part of the country, the village headman was known as the grama bhojaka. Usually, men from the same family held the position for generations. In other words, the post was hereditary. The grama bhojaka was often the largest landowner. Generally, he had slaves and hired workers to cultivate the land. Besides, as he was powerful, the king often used him to collect taxes from the village. He also functioned as a judge, and sometimes as a policeman. \nApart from the gramabhojaka, there were other independent farmers, known as grihapatis, most of whom were smaller landowners. And then there were men and women such as the dasa karmakara, who did not own land, and had to earn a living working on the fields owned by others. \nIn most villages there were also some crafts persons such as the blacksmith, potter, carpenter and weaver. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for the Muslim League's initial demand for 'Independent States' for Muslims, and how did their performance in the 1946 provincial elections impact their subsequent demand for 'Pakistan'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains several primary factors for the Muslim League's demand for 'Independent States' for Muslims. Firstly, from the late 1930s, the League began to view Muslims as a separate 'nation' from Hindus, potentially influenced by historical tensions between the two communities in the 1920s and 1930s. Secondly, the provincial elections of 1937 convinced the League that Muslims, as a minority, would consistently play a subordinate role in any democratic system and feared they might go unrepresented. Thirdly, the Congress's refusal to form a joint government with the League in the United Provinces in 1937 further alienated them.

More significantly, the 1937 provincial elections convinced the League that Muslims would be a perpetual minority, fearing unrepresentation in a democratic structure, and they were further alienated by the Congress's rejection of a joint government in the United Provinces.

Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Nation, Sixty Years On \n\n On 15 August 2007, India celebrated sixty years of its existence as a free nation. How well has the country done in this time? And to what extent has it fulfilled the ideals set out in its Constitution? \nThat India is still united, and that it is still democratic, are achievements that we might justly be proud of. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country, that it would break up into many parts, with each region or linguistic group seeking to form a nation of its own. Others believed that it would come under military rule. However, as many as thirteen general elections have been held since Independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections. There is a free press, as well as an independent judiciary.Finally, the fact that people speak different languages or practise different faiths has not come in the way of national unity. \nOn the other hand, deep divisions persist. Despite constitutional guarantees, the Untouchables or, as they are now referred to, the Dalits, face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks and otherpublic places. And despite the secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution, there have been clashes between different religious groups in many states. Above all, as many observers have noted, the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development. They live in large houses and dine in expensive restaurants, send their children to expensive private schools and take expensive foreign holidays. At the same time many others continue to live below the poverty line. Housed in urban slums, or living in remote villages on lands that yield little, they cannot afford to send their children to school. \nThe Constitution recognises equality before the law, but in real life some Indians are more equal than others. Judged by the standards it set itself at Independence, the Republic of India has not been a great success. But it has not been a failure either. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather than janas. The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red. One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and geometric patterns. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what archaeological evidence from ancient graves suggests social status differences, and how do these findings relate to the social divisions described in modern India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The first text describes archaeological findings at Brahmagiri where one skeleton was buried with a significant collection of valuable items (33 gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and one conch shell), in contrast to 'Other skeletons [that] have only a few pots.'\n2. The text explicitly states that 'These finds suggest that there was some difference in status amongst the people who were buried. Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers.' This provides the archaeological evidence for ancient social status differences.\n3. The second text, 'The Nation, Sixty Years On,' discusses modern India, noting that 'deep divisions persist' and 'the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years.' It highlights that 'some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development' while 'many others continue to live below the poverty line,' indicating ongoing social and economic inequality.\n4. Therefore, the archaeological evidence of varying grave goods points to early forms of social stratification based on wealth and status, which relates to the persistent social divisions and the growing gap between the rich and the poor observed in modern India, where economic development has benefited some groups significantly more than others.\n\nAnswer: Archaeological evidence from ancient graves, such as the varying grave goods found at Brahmagiri (e.g., one skeleton with 33 gold beads and copper bangles versus others with only a few pots), suggests differences in social status among the buried, indicating some were rich or chiefs while others were poor or followers. This relates to modern India where, despite constitutional ideals, deep divisions persist, and the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown, with some benefiting greatly from economic development while many others live below the poverty line, illustrating a continuation of social and economic inequality across different eras."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.7", "8.10.6", "6.6.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here.

It also highlights that it's often 'incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time' and that focusing on 'a span of time, an approximate period' is more appropriate.\n3.  **Synthesize the connection:** The Hunsgi description exemplifies this modern historical approach because it provides insights into the 'how' and 'what' of early human life \u2013 their activities, production methods, and settlements \u2013 during the 'early Palaeolithic' period, rather than providing specific, precise dates. This aligns with the contemporary historical focus on understanding the broader social and economic aspects of past societies and changes over a span of time, moving beyond a mere 'string of dates'.\n\nAnswer: The description of Hunsgi reflects the modern historical approach by focusing on the activities and livelihoods of early people, such as the discovery of numerous tools indicating 'habitation-cum factory sites' and 'tool making' from 'locally available limestone.'

Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally, fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river. In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other.

It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland.

How did men become rulers in the past? Some of the rajas we read about in Chapter 5 were probably chosen by the jana, the people. But, around 3000 years ago, we find some changes taking place in the ways in which rajas were chosen. Some men now became recognised as rajas by performing very big sacrifices. \nThe ashvamedha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely and it was guarded by the raja\u2019s men. If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them. These rajas were then invited to the sacrifice, which was performed by specially trained priests, who were rewarded with gifts. The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him. \nThe raja was a central figure in these rituals. He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in the battle field and witnessed his exploits, chanted tales of his glory. His relatives, especially his wives and sons, had to perform a variety of minor rituals. The other rajas were simply spectators who had to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice. Priests performed the rituals including the sprinkling of sacred water on the king. The ordinary people, the vish or vaishya, also brought gifts. However, some people, such as those who were regarded as shudras by the priests, were excluded from many rituals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nYou may have noticed that each of these ruling dynasties was based in a specific region. At the same time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj. Because there were three \u201cparties\u201d in this longdrawn conflict, historians often describe it as the \u201ctripartite struggle\u201d. \nAs we will see (pp. 62-66), rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples. So, when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms, they often chose to target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich. You will read more about this in Chapter 5. \nOne of the best known of such rulers is Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. He ruled from 997 to 1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia, Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent. He raided the subcontinent almost every year \u2013 his targets were wealthy temples, including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni. \nSultan Mahmud was also interested in finding out more about the people he conquered, and entrusted a scholar named Al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent. This Arabic work, known as the Kitab ul-Hind, remains an important source for historians. He consulted Sanskrit scholars to prepare this account. \nOther kings who engaged in warfare included the Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They attempted to expand their control to the west and the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh. The best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very next year, in 1192. \nSultan - An Arabic term meaning ruler. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the various ways rulers in ancient and medieval times established or demonstrated their power and authority?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for different ways rulers established or demonstrated their power based on both provided text sections. \n\nFrom the first text section, rulers demonstrated power by: \n1.  Engaging in conflict for control over prized areas, such as the city of Kanauj, leading to prolonged struggles like the 'tripartite struggle' involving the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta, and Pala dynasties. \n2.  Building large temples, which served as demonstrations of their power and resources. \n3.  Attacking and targeting temples in rival kingdoms, especially wealthy ones, during warfare. \n4.  Extending control over vast regions, as exemplified by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, who ruled over parts of Central Asia, Iran, and the north-western subcontinent. \n5.  Raiding wealthy areas, particularly temples (like Somnath), and using the carried-away wealth to create splendid capital cities (Sultan Mahmud at Ghazni). \n6.  Commissioning scholars to write accounts of the people and lands they conquered, such as Sultan Mahmud entrusting Al-Biruni to write the Kitab ul-Hind. \n7.  Engaging in warfare to expand control and defeat other rulers, as shown by the Chahamanas and Prithviraja III's conflict with Sultan Muhammad Ghori.\n\nFrom the second text section, rulers became recognized or demonstrated power by: \n1.  Performing 'very big sacrifices,' such as the ashvamedha or horse sacrifice. \n2.  Having their strength acknowledged by other rajas, indicated if they allowed the sacrificial horse to pass through their kingdoms without stopping it. \n3.  Organizing sacrifices, which led to them being recognized as 'very powerful' and receiving gifts from attending rajas and ordinary people (vish or vaishya). \n4.  Occupying a central, special seat (throne or tiger skin) during rituals. \n5.  Having their charioteer chant tales of their glory during rituals. \n\nCombining these points from both texts provides a comprehensive answer.\n\nAnswer: Rulers established or demonstrated their power and authority in several ways: by fighting for control over prized regions like Kanauj, building large temples, attacking wealthy temples of rival kingdoms during warfare, extending control over vast territories, using acquired wealth to construct splendid capital cities, commissioning scholars to document their conquered lands, and engaging in direct military conflict. In earlier times, power was also established through performing grand sacrifices such as the ashvamedha, where allowing the sacrificial horse to pass signified acceptance of the performing raja's strength, leading to the raja being recognized as powerful and receiving gifts."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.4", "6.6.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Different animals too, prefer different environments \u2014 for instance, sheep and goat can survive more easily than cattle in dry, hilly environments.

This site is located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass, which is one of the most important routes into Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places where women and men learnt to grow barley and wheat, and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know about. \nArchaeologists who excavated the site found evidence of many kinds of animal bones from the earliest levels. These included bones of wild animals such as the deer and pig. In later levels, they found more bones of sheep and goat, and in still later levels, cattle bones are most common, suggesting that this was the animal that was generally kept by the people. \nOther finds at Mehrgarh include remains of square or rectangular houses. Each house had four or more compartments, some of which may have been used for storage. \nWhen people die, their relatives and friends generally pay respect to them. People look after them, perhaps in the belief that there is some form of life after death. Burial is one such arrangement. Several burial sites have been found at Mehrgarh. In one instance, the dead person was buried with goats, which were probably meant to serve as food in the next world. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMutiny \u2013 When soldiers as a group disobey their officers in the army. Firangis \u2013 Foreigners The term reflects an attitude of contempt. \nA Mutiny Becomes a Popular Rebellion \n\n Though struggles between rulers and the ruled are not unusual, sometimes such struggles become quite widespread as a popular resistance so that the power of the state breaks down. A very large number of people begin to believe that they have a common enemy and rise up against the enemy at the same time. For such a situation to develop people have to organise, communicate, take initiative and display the confidence to turn the situation around. \nSuch a situation developed in the northern parts of India in 1857. After a hundred years of conquest and administration, the English East India Company faced a massive rebellion that started in May 1857 and threatened the Company\u2019s very presence in India. Sepoys mutinied in several places beginning from Meerut and a large number of people from different sections of society rose up in rebellion. Some regard it as the biggest armed resistance to colonialism in the nineteenth century anywhere in the world. \nFrom Meerut to Delhi \n On 29 March 1857, a young soldier, Mangal Pandey, was hanged to death for attacking his officers in Barrackpore. Some days later, some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges, which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs. Eighty-five sepoys were dismissed from service and sentenced to ten years in jail for disobeying their officers. This happened on 9 May 1857. \nThe response of the other Indian soldiers in Meerut was quite extraordinary. On 10 May, the soldiers marched to the jail in Meerut and released the imprisoned sepoys. They attacked and killed British officers. They captured guns and ammunition and set fire to the buildings and properties of the British and declared war on the firangis. The soldiers were determined to bring an end to their rule in the country. But who would rule the land instead? The soldiers had an answer to this question \u2013 the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. \nThe sepoys of Meerut rode all night of 10 May to reach Delhi in the early hours next morning. As news of their arrival spread, the regiments stationed in Delhi also rose up in rebellion. Again british officers were killed, arms and ammunition seized, buildings set on fire. Triumphant soldiers gathered around the walls of the Red Fort where the Badshah lived, demanding to meet him. The emperor was not quite willing to challenge the mighty British power but the soldiers persisted. They forced their way into the palace and proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. \nThe ageing emperor had to accept this demand. He wrote letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight the British. This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had great implications. \nThe Mughal dynasty had ruled over a very large part of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains controlled dif ferent territories on behalf of the Mughal ruler. Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many of them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, they too would be able to rule their own territories once more, under Mughal authority. \nThe British had not expected this to happen. They thought the disturbance caused by the issue of the cartridges would die down. But Bahadur Shah Zafar\u2019s decision to bless the rebellion changed the entire situation dramatically. Often when people see an alternative possibility they feel inspired and enthused. It gives them the courage, hope and confidence to act. \nThe rebellion spreads \n After the British were routed from Delhi, there was no uprising for almost a week. It took that much time for news to travel. Then, a spurt of mutinies began. \nRegiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join other troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow. After them, the people of the towns and villages also rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to establish their authority and fight the British. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the late Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered armed forces and expelled the British garrison from the city. He proclaimed himself Peshwa. He declared that he was a governor under Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. In Lucknow, Birjis Qadr, the son of the deposed Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, was proclaimed the new Nawab. He too acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahadur Shah Zafar. His mother Begum Hazrat Mahal took an active part in organising the uprising against the British. In Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai joined the rebel sepoys and fought the British along with Tantia Tope, the general of Nana Saheb. In the Mandla region of Madhya Pradesh, Rani Avantibai Lodhi of Ramgarh raised and led an army of four thousand against the British who had taken over the administration of her state. \nThe British were greatly outnumbered by the rebel forces. They were defeated in a number of battles. This convinced the people that the rule of the British had collapsed for good and gave them the confidence to take the plunge and join the rebellion. A situation of widespread popular rebellion developed in the region of Awadh in particular. On 6 August 1857, we find a telegram sent by Lieutenant Colonel Tytler to his Commander-in-Chief expressing the fear felt by the British: \u201cOur men are cowed by the numbers opposed to them and the endless fighting. Every village is held against us, the zamindars have risen to oppose us.\u201d \nMany new leaders came up. For example, Ahmadullah Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, prophesied that the rule of the British would come to an end soon. He caught the imagination of the people and raised a huge force of supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British. In Delhi, a large number of ghazis or religious warriors came together to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came to Delhi. He became a key military leader of the rebellion. In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel sepoys and battled with the British for many months. Leaders and fighters from across the land joined the fight. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the immediate causes of the 1857 rebellion in Meerut, how did the sepoys react, and how did Bahadur Shah Zafar's involvement contribute to its wider spread?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that on 9 May 1857, 'some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges, which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs.' This refusal led to 85 sepoys being dismissed and jailed. The reaction of other Indian soldiers in Meerut was to march to the jail on 10 May, release the imprisoned sepoys, attack and kill British officers, capture weapons, set fire to British properties, and declare war on the 'firangis'. They also decided to make the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar their leader. Bahadur Shah Zafar's involvement contributed significantly to the rebellion's spread because, after being forced to accept leadership, 'He wrote letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight the British.' The text emphasizes that 'This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had great implications' and that his decision 'to bless the rebellion changed the entire situation dramatically,' inspiring people with courage, hope, and confidence to act, leading to a widespread 'spurt of mutinies' and popular rebellion.\n\nAnswer: The immediate cause of the 1857 rebellion in Meerut was the refusal of sepoys to use new cartridges, suspected of being coated with animal fat. In response, 85 sepoys were dismissed and jailed. Other soldiers in Meerut reacted by releasing the imprisoned sepoys, attacking British officers, seizing arms, burning British properties, and declaring war, proclaiming Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. Bahadur Shah Zafar's involvement contributed to the rebellion's wider spread by inspiring many when he wrote letters to rulers across the country, urging them to form a confederacy against the British, thereby legitimizing and expanding the uprising beyond its initial military points."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.9", "6.3.1", "8.5.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary challenges India faced immediately after gaining independence in August 1947?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that 'When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges.'

It is likely that people made and used tools of stone, wood and bone, of which stone tools have survived best. \nSome of these stone tools were used to cut meat and bone, scrape bark (from trees) and hides (animal skins), chop fruit and roots. Some may have been attached to handles of bone or wood, to make spears and arrows for hunting. Other tools were used to chop wood, which was used as firewood. Wood was also used to make huts and tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about the past depending upon the period of their study and the nature of their investigation. Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later. The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in large library collections. \nArchive - A place where documents and manuscripts are stored. Today all national and state governments have archives where they keep all their old official records and transactions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: During the period from roughly 700 to 1750 CE, what were the primary challenges historians faced when using textual records, and what was the underlying cause of these difficulties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use' for the period from roughly 700 to 1750 CE.

Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was in no other place. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited his father\u2019s estate. Instead they followed the Mughal and Timurid custom of coparcenary inheritance, or a division of the inheritance amongst all the sons. Follow the highlighted passages in Table 1, and note the evidence for rebellions by Mughal princes. Which do you think is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture or coparcenary ? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhile many people lived in the cities, others living in the countryside grew crops and reared animals. These farmers and herders supplied food to crafts persons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We know from remains of plants that the Harappans grew wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed and mustard. \nA new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds. While real ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have not survived, toy models have been found. As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used. This means that water was stored and supplied to the fields when the plants were growing. \nThe Harappans reared cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available around settlements. However, in the dry summer months large herds of animals were probably taken to greater distances in search of grass and water. They also collected fruits like ber, caught fish and hunted wild animals like the antelope. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Sufis distinguish their spiritual path from more traditional interpretations of Islam, and what specific methods did they employ for spiritual training under the guidance of a master?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes Sufis as Muslim mystics who distinguished their path by rejecting outward religiosity and emphasizing love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings.

Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArvind was supposed to be acting as Samudragupta, a famous ruler of a dynasty known as the Guptas. We know about Samudragupta from a long inscription, inscribed on the Ashokan pillar at Allahabad.

This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these long journeys. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What distinct types of historical evidence are mentioned across the provided texts for understanding ancient urban planning, the reign of Samudragupta, and the economic distribution within the Mughal Empire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, days or years \u2013 as a clock or a calendar. Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, how did British historians divide the history of India, and what were the main criticisms of this periodisation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that in the middle of the nineteenth century, British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d.

There are four of them \u2013 the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or \u201cwell-said\u201d. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. \nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis). Priests taught students to recite and memorise each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with great care. Most of the hymns were composed, taught and learnt by men. A few were composed by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. \nThe books we use are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) than about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwara. \nBefore his death in 1539, Baba Guru Nanak appointed one of his followers as his successor. His name was Lehna but he came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that he was a part of Baba Guru Nanak himself. Guru Angad compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur\u2019s son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as \u2018a state within the state\u2019. The Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement. The ideas of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this development from the very beginning. He emphasised the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications. This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe often take the use of iron for granted today.

Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the primary reasons for the decline of Indian textile dominance in world markets and the subsequent rise of the British textile industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that around 1750, India was the world's largest producer of cotton textiles, highly valued for quality and craftsmanship, and widely traded. From the 1680s, there was a significant 'craze' for Indian printed cotton textiles, such as chintz, in England and Europe due to their exquisite floral designs, fine texture, and relative cheapness. This popularity, however, led to protests from English wool and silk makers by the early eighteenth century, who were worried about the competition from Indian textiles. In response, the British government enacted the Calico Act in 1720, which banned the use of printed cotton textiles (chintz) in England to protect its nascent textile industries and secure a domestic market. Furthermore, the competition with Indian textiles spurred technological innovation in England, leading to inventions like the spinning jenny (1764) and the steam engine (1786), which revolutionized cotton textile weaving, allowing for the production of immense quantities of cloth cheaply. These developments in Britain ultimately led to the decline of Indian textiles by creating competition in European and American markets, imposing very high duties on Indian textiles imported into Britain, and eventually flooding Indian markets with cheaper British cotton cloth by the 1830s, thereby ousting Indian goods.\n\nAnswer: The decline of Indian textile dominance and the rise of the British textile industry were primarily due to the intense popularity of Indian textiles in Europe which prompted protests from English manufacturers, leading to protective legislation like the Calico Act of 1720, and spurred technological innovations such as the spinning jenny and steam engine in Britain. These advancements enabled Britain to produce textiles cheaply, compete globally, impose high duties on Indian imports, and ultimately flood Indian markets with their own goods."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.6.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

How did men become rulers in the past? Some of the rajas we read about in Chapter 5 were probably chosen by the jana, the people. But, around 3000 years ago, we find some changes taking place in the ways in which rajas were chosen. Some men now became recognised as rajas by performing very big sacrifices. \nThe ashvamedha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely and it was guarded by the raja\u2019s men. If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them. These rajas were then invited to the sacrifice, which was performed by specially trained priests, who were rewarded with gifts. The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him. \nThe raja was a central figure in these rituals. He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in the battle field and witnessed his exploits, chanted tales of his glory. His relatives, especially his wives and sons, had to perform a variety of minor rituals. The other rajas were simply spectators who had to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice. Priests performed the rituals including the sprinkling of sacred water on the king. The ordinary people, the vish or vaishya, also brought gifts. However, some people, such as those who were regarded as shudras by the priests, were excluded from many rituals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, how did the Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) ritual serve to establish and demonstrate a raja's power and superiority over other rulers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that the Ashvamedha ritual was a method by which some men became recognized as rajas. It details that if a horse, guarded by the performing raja's men, wandered into other kingdoms and was allowed to pass, it explicitly meant that those other rajas 'accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them.' Conversely, if they stopped the horse, they 'had to fight,' implying a challenge to the performing raja's power. Furthermore, the text states that 'The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him,' directly demonstrating his authority and the acknowledgment of his power. Finally, the text notes that 'The other rajas were simply spectators who had to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice,' underscoring their subordinate role compared to the central figure of the organizing raja.\n\nAnswer: The Ashvamedha ritual established a raja's power by requiring other rajas to either fight if they stopped the wandering horse or accept the performing raja's superior strength if they allowed it to pass. The organizing raja was recognized as very powerful, received gifts from all attendees, and other rajas were reduced to mere spectators, thereby demonstrating his dominance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.6.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nRuling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent with such a diversity of people and cultures was an extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplish in the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the various ways rulers, including kings and sultans, demonstrated their power, legitimacy, and connection to either divine authority or the welfare of their subjects."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  The first section indicates that 'rulers, also known as kshatriyas,' were expected to 'fight battles and protect people.' It also mentions 'Some kings thought they were superior to the priests,' showing an assertion of authority against the established social order. \n2.  The second section extensively details how rulers demonstrated their power and legitimacy. \n    *   **Divine connection and power through religious structures:** Kings constructed elaborate temples (e.g., Rajarajeshvara temple) to 'demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron.' They would take god's names (e.g., King Rajarajadeva for god Rajarajeshvaram) because it was 'auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god.' Temples were considered 'a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies.' Muslim Sultans were described as the 'Shadow of God,' with inscriptions explaining God chose them for qualities like those of great lawgivers. Constructing places of worship allowed rulers to 'proclaim their close relationship with God.'\n    *   **Welfare and just rule:** Rulers also demonstrated their concern for subjects and reinforced their image as just leaders by 'making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs' for ordinary people (e.g., Sultan Iltutmish's Hauz-i-Sultani), which was 'highly praised.' This was linked to the belief that 'the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain.'\n    *   **Cultural patronage:** Rulers further sought to establish fame and legitimacy by transforming their 'capitals and cities into great cultural centres.'\n3.  The final answer synthesizes these points, showing how rulers used military roles, challenges to priestly authority, religious architecture, divine association, public works for welfare, and cultural development to assert and demonstrate their authority.\n\nAnswer: Rulers demonstrated their power and legitimacy in several ways. Early rulers, known as kshatriyas, were expected to fight battles and protect people, and some kings asserted their authority by considering themselves superior to priests. Later, kings and sultans constructed magnificent temples and mosques, which served to demonstrate their power, wealth, and devotion. Kings would take names similar to gods to appear divine, and temples were seen as miniature models of their ruled world. Muslim Sultans were described as the 'Shadow of God,' chosen for their lawgiving qualities. Rulers used these constructions to proclaim a close relationship with God. Additionally, rulers showed concern for their subjects' welfare and reinforced their image as just leaders by constructing tanks and reservoirs, like Sultan Iltutmish's Hauz-i-Sultani, making precious water available, as a just king's rule was believed to bring plenty. They also transformed capitals into great cultural centers to bring fame to their rule."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.6.2", "7.5.3", "7.4.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said.

The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain. As the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \u201cThey are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others.\u201d \nThe Vaishnava poet-saints of Maharashtra such as Jnaneshwar, Namadeva, Eknath and Tukaram were devotees of lord Vitthala. Devotion around lord Vitthala gave rise to the Varkari sect which lay emphasis on an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur. The cult of Vitthala emerged as a powerful mode of devotion and was very popular amongst the people. \nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant Tukaram: He who identifies with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart He treats A slave As his own son Says Tuka I won\u2019t be tired to repeat again Such a man Is God In person. Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela\u2019s son: You made us low caste, Why don\u2019t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life \u2013 left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this. You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha\u2019s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen in Chapter 2 that the climate of the world was changing, and so were plants and animals that people used as food. Men, women and children probably observed several things: the places where edible plants were found, how seeds broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. Perhaps they began looking after plants \u2014 protecting them from birds and animals so that they could grow and the seeds could ripen. In this way people became farmers. \nWomen, men and children could also attract and then tame animals by leaving food for them near their shelters. The first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that were relatively gentle to come near the camps where they lived. These animals such as sheep, goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and most of them ate grass. Often, people protected these animals from attacks by other wild animals. This is how they became herders. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLet us see what Samudragupta\u2019s prashasti tells us. The poet praised the king in glowing terms \u2014 as a warrior, as a king who won victories in battle, who was learned and the best of poets. He is also described as equal to the gods. The prashasti was composed in very long sentences. \nHarishena describes four different kinds of rulers, and tells us about Samudragupta\u2019s policies towards them. \n1. The rulers of Aryavarta, the area shaded in green on the map. Here there were nine rulers who were uprooted, and their kingdoms were made a part of Samudragupta\u2019s empire. \n2. The rulers of Dakshinapatha. Here there were twelve rulers, some of whose capitals are marked with red dots on the map. They surrendered to Samudragupta after being defeated and he then allowed them to rule again. \n3. The inner circle of neighbouring states, including Assam, coastal Bengal, Nepal, and a number of gana sanghas (remember Chapter 6) in the northwest, marked in purple on the map. They brought tribute, followed his orders, and attended his court. \n4. The rulers of the outlying areas, marked in blue on the map, perhaps the descendants of the Kushanas and Shakas, and the ruler of Sri Lanka, who submitted to him and offered daughters in marriage. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThrough the Eyes of the People \n\n To get a glimpse of what people were thinking those days about British rule, study Sources 1 and 2. \n The list of eighty-four rules \n Given here are excerpts from the book Majha Pravaas, written by Vishnubhatt Godse, a Brahman from a village in Maharashtra. He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nSurat in Gujarat was the emporium of western trade during the Mughal period along with Cambay (presentday Khambat) and somewhat later, Ahmedabad. Surat was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf of Ormuz. Surat has also been called the gate to Mecca because many pilgrim ships set sail from here. \nEmporium : A place where goods from diverse production centres are bought and sold. \nThe city was cosmopolitan and people of all castes and creeds lived there. In the seventeenth century the Portuguese, Dutch and English had their factories and warehouses at Surat. According to the English chronicler Ovington who wrote an account of the port in 1689, on average a hundred ships of different countries could be found anchored at the port at any given time. \nThere were also several retail and wholesale shops selling cotton textiles. The textiles of Surat were famous for their gold lace borders (zari) and had a market in West Asia, Africa and Europe. The state built numerous rest-houses to take care of the needs of people from all over the world who came to the city. There were magnificent buildings and innumerable pleasure parks. The Kathiawad seths or mahajans (moneychangers) had huge banking houses at Surat. It is noteworthy that the Surat hundis were honoured in the far-off markets of Cairo in Egypt, Basra in Iraq and Antwerp in Belgium. \nHundi is a note recording a deposit made by a person. The amount deposited can be claimed in another place by presenting the record of the deposit. \nHowever, Surat began to decline towards the end of the seventeenth century. This was because of many factors: the loss of markets and productivity because of the decline of the Mughal Empire, control of the sea routes by the Portuguese and competition from Bombay (present-day Mumbai) where the English East India Company shifted its headquarters in 1668. Today, Surat is a bustling commercial centre. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the core tenets of the Maharashtrian bhakti tradition regarding social and religious practices, and what specific religious and political concerns fueled the sepoy unrest against British rule?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for two distinct sets of information: the core tenets of the Maharashtrian bhakti tradition and the reasons for sepoy unrest. \n\nFor the Maharashtrian bhakti tradition, the first text section states that the saint-poets \"rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth.\" It also notes their rejection of renunciation, preference for living with families, and emphasis on \"humbly serving fellow human beings in need,\" with the humanist idea that \"bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain.\" This tradition focused on the Vitthala temple in Pandharpur and the \"notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people.\"\n\nFor the sepoy unrest, the third text section, 'Through the Eyes of the People,' provides the reasons.

As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nTurn to Map 2 (page14).

Some of the most important ones are in the north-west, in present-day Kashmir, and in east and south India \nTo find out whether these sites were settlements of farmers and herders, scientists study evidence of plants and animal bones. One of the most exciting finds includes remains of burnt grain. (These may have been burnt accidentally or on purpose). Scientists can identify these grains, and so we know that a number of crops were grown in different parts of the subcontinent. They can also identify the bones of different animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Company Fights Back \n\n Unnerved by the scale of the upheaval, the Company decided to repress the revolt with all its might. It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum Zinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in November 1862. \nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the rebellion died down after that. People continued to resist and battle the British. The British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. Lucknow was taken in March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate awaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, chose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on all sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India and continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of many tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried and killed in April 1859. \nJust as victories against the British had earlier encouraged rebellion, the defeat of rebel forces encouraged desertions. The British also tried their best to win back the loyalty of the people. They announced rewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British, and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied. Nevertheless, hundreds of sepoys, rebels, nawabs and rajas were tried and hanged. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nTake a look at Maps 1 and 2. Map 1 was made in 1154 CE by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi. The section reproduced here is a detail of the Indian subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The two maps are quite different even though they are of the same area. In al-Idrisi\u2019s map, south India is where we would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the island at the top. Place-names are marked in Arabic, and there are some well-known names like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (spelt in the map as Qanauj). Map 2 was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during which time information about the subcontinent had changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly detailed. This map was used by European sailors and merchants on their voyages (see Chapter 6). \nEqually important is the fact that the science of cartography differed in the two periods. When historians read documents, maps and texts from the past they have to be sensitive to the different historical backgrounds \u2013 the contexts \u2013 in which information about the past was produced. \nCartographer - A person who makes maps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What measures did the Company implement to quell the widespread rebellion, and what was the ultimate fate of prominent rebel figures like Bahadur Shah Zafar and Rani Lakshmibai?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about the Company's actions to suppress a rebellion and the fate of key rebel leaders.

Given below are the important changes that were introduced by the British. \n1. The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of Indian affairs. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a council to advise him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. Through these measures the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India. \n2. All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as subordinates of the British Crown. \n3. It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4. The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British believed that they were responsible for the rebellion in a big way. \n 5. The British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India. \n 6. Policies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and give them security of rights over their lands. \n Thus a new phase of history began after 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study \n Much before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at a place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country. \nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of Odisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and 1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no inclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Odisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817. \nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures. It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of shortterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case of natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal. \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these grievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of making salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape. \nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took away a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions with Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started. The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The priests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support. \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha. Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi jagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed, many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by May 1817 the uprising was mostly contained. \nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May 1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and forbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary reforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \n In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had far reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To merely call it a \u2018Paik Rebellion\u2019 will thus be an understatement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary causes that led to the Khurda Uprising of 1817, and how did the British initially suppress it and subsequently modify their policies in the region?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for the causes, initial suppression, and subsequent policy changes related to the Khurda Uprising. I will extract these details from the 'Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study' section.\n\nFirst, for the causes, the text states that Raja Mukunda Dev II was disturbed by the loss of territories and rights, leading him to negotiate with the British who later showed no inclination to oblige him (paragraph 2). Consequently, he was deposed and his territories annexed, receiving only a small grant and management rights of the Jagannath Temple (paragraph 2). Furthermore, the British policy of resuming service tenures severely affected the Paiks (ex-militia), compounded by unreasonable increases in revenue demand and oppressive collection methods (paragraph 3). Other grievances included the introduction of sicca rupee and insistence on payment in the new currency, an unprecedented rise in foodstuff and salt prices due to salt monopoly, auction of local estates to absentee landlords from Bengal, and an insensitive and corrupt police system (paragraph 4). Buxi Jagabandhu, a dispossessed land-holder, also became a key figure due to these grievances (paragraph 4).\n\nSecond, regarding the initial suppression, the text describes the uprising starting on March 29, 1817, with attacks on Banpur (paragraph 5). When the situation escalated, with Paiks seizing Puri and declaring Mukunda Dev II ruler, the British clamped Martial Law, captured the King, and sent him to prison (paragraph 6). Major-General Martindell was sent to clear the area, and rewards were announced for the arrest of Buxi Jagabandhu (paragraph 6). This operation resulted in hundreds of Paiks killed, many fleeing, and some returning under amnesty, thus mostly containing the uprising by May 1817 (paragraph 6).\n\nThird, concerning subsequent policy modifications, the text notes that after the uprising was mostly contained (though Buxi Jagabandhu sustained it until 1825), the British adopted a policy of 'leniency, indulgence and forbearance' towards the people of Khurda (paragraph 7). Specific reforms included reducing the price of salt, making necessary reforms in the police and justice systems, dismissing corrupt revenue officials, and restoring former land-holders to their lands (paragraph 7). The king's son, Ram Chandra Dev III, was also allowed to move to Puri and manage the Jagannath Temple with a grant (paragraph 7).\n\nAnswer: The primary causes of the Khurda Uprising of 1817 included the British refusal to restore lost territories and rights to Raja Mukunda Dev II after their occupation of Odisha in 1803, leading to his deposition and an unfair settlement. This was aggravated by the British policy of resuming service tenures affecting the Paiks, unreasonable increases in revenue demand, oppressive collection methods, the introduction of sicca rupee and insistence on new currency payments, unprecedented rises in foodstuff and salt prices due to a salt monopoly, the auction of local estates to absentee landlords, and a corrupt police system.\n\nInitially, the British suppressed the uprising by clamping Martial Law, capturing King Mukunda Dev II, sending Major-General Martindell to clear the area, and announcing rewards for Buxi Jagabandhu's arrest. This operation led to numerous Paik casualties, with many fleeing or returning under amnesty, largely containing the uprising by May 1817.\n\nSubsequently, the British adopted a policy of 'leniency, indulgence and forbearance' towards the people of Khurda. They reduced the price of salt, reformed the police and justice systems, dismissed corrupt revenue officials, restored former land-holders, and allowed the king's son, Ram Chandra Dev III, to manage the Jagannath Temple with a grant."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.5.5", "7.5.6", "8.5.5", "8.5.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The amount deposited can be claimed in another place by presenting the record of the deposit. \nHowever, Surat began to decline towards the end of the seventeenth century.

The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, what were the primary reasons for the Muslim League's demand for an autonomous arrangement for Muslims, how did their political standing shift by 1946, and what role did the British Cabinet Mission play in the eventual path to Partition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text states that the Muslim League moved a resolution in 1940 demanding 'Independent States' for Muslims. \n2. It explains the reasons for this demand: the League began viewing Muslims as a separate 'nation' from Hindus, influenced by historical tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups. \n3. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 convinced the League that Muslims were a minority who would always play second fiddle and might even go unrepresented in a democratic structure. \n4. The Congress's rejection of the League's desire to form a joint government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \n5. The League's political standing shifted significantly by 1946, as the provincial elections held that year showed that while the Congress did well in 'General' constituencies, the League's success in the seats reserved for Muslims was 'spectacular'. This success led them to persist with their demand for 'Pakistan'.\n6. In March 1946, the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi (the Cabinet Mission) to examine this demand and suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. \n7. The mission suggested that India should remain united as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. \n8. However, the mission 'could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal', leading to the conclusion that 'Partition now became more or less inevitable'.\n\nAnswer: The primary reasons for the Muslim League's demand for an autonomous arrangement for Muslims stemmed from their view of Muslims as a separate 'nation' from Hindus, influenced by historical tensions and the fear, after the 1937 provincial elections, that Muslims as a minority would always be secondary and potentially unrepresented in a democratic structure. The Congress's rejection of a joint government in 1937 further annoyed the League. By 1946, the League's political standing shifted dramatically due to their spectacular success in the provincial elections for seats reserved for Muslims. The British Cabinet Mission, sent in March 1946, proposed a united India as a loose confederation with autonomy for Muslim-majority areas, but its failure to secure agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League on the proposal's details made Partition more or less inevitable."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.9.7", "7.6.9", "6.11.1", "6.12.5", "6.5.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}
