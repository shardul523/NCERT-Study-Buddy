A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that are similar and circle those that are different. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFigure 1 shows the first balcony of the Qutb Minar. Qutbuddin Aybak had this constructed around 1199. Notice the pattern created under the balcony by the small arches and geometrical designs. Can you see two bands of inscriptions under the balcony? These are in Arabic. Notice that the surface of the minar is curved and angular. Placing an inscription on such a surface required great precision. Only the most skilled craftsperson could perform this task. Remember that very few buildings were made of stone or brick 800 years ago. What would have been the impact of a building like the Qutb Minar on observers in the thirteenth century? \nBetween the eighth and the eighteenth centuries kings and their officers built two kinds of structures: the first were forts, palaces, garden residences and tombs \u2013 safe, protected and grandiose places of rest in this world and the next; the second were structures meant for public activity including temples, mosques, tanks, wells, caravanserais and bazaars. Kings were expected to care for their subjects, and by making structures for their use and comfort, rulers hoped to win their praise. Construction activity was also carried out by others, including merchants. They built temples, mosques and wells. However, domestic architecture \u2013 large mansions (havelis) of merchants \u2013 has survived only from the eighteenth century. \nBuilt by Akbar, the Agra Fort required 2,000 stone-cutters, 2,000 cement and lime-makers and 8,000 labourers \nThe Qutb Minar is five storeys high. The band of inscriptions you see are under its first balcony. The first floor was constructed by Qutbuddin Aybak and the rest by Iltutmish around 1229. Over the years it was damaged by lightning and earthquakes and repaired by Alauddin Khalji, Muhammad Tughluq, Firuz Shah Tughluq and Ibrahim Lodi. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what types of structures were built in different historical contexts, who were the primary builders or funders, and what materials were commonly used?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Ancient Cities (First section):** The text describes cities divided into a smaller, higher citadel and a larger, lower town.

Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here.

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were two different aspects of the English East India Company's engagement or interests in India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that 'the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory' and that 'British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products'.

The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen that the earliest people hunted, gathered plant produce, made stone tools, and painted on cave walls. Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, days or years \u2013 as a clock or a calendar. Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFranchise \u2013 The right to vote. \n \nA Constitution is Written \n\n Between December 1946 and November 1949, some three hundred Indians had a series of meetings on the country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key features of the Indian Constitution regarding universal adult franchise and social equality, and who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee responsible for its finalization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950, had several key features. One significant feature was its adoption of 'universal adult franchise,' allowing all Indians above the age of 21 to vote. This was considered a 'revolutionary step' because, unlike countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States where this right was granted in stages and often restricted by property, education, or gender, India chose to grant it to all citizens 'regardless of gender, class or education' soon after Independence. A second feature was the guarantee of 'equality before the law' to all citizens, irrespective of their caste or religious affiliation, explicitly rejecting the idea of a 'Hindu state' and ensuring equal rights for various religious communities. A third feature addressed social equality by offering 'special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians,' which included the abolition of 'untouchability' and the provision of reservations for 'Scheduled Castes' (formerly Untouchables) and 'adivasis or Scheduled Tribes' in legislatures and government jobs to rectify historical deprivation and discrimination. The text also explicitly identifies 'Dr B.R. Ambedkar' as having played 'perhaps the most important role' as the 'Chairman of the Drafting Committee' under whose supervision the document was finalised.\n\nAnswer: The Indian Constitution adopted universal adult franchise, allowing all Indians over 21 to vote immediately regardless of gender, class, or education, a revolutionary approach compared to other nations. It also guaranteed equality before the law for all citizens irrespective of caste or religious affiliation and provided special privileges for disadvantaged groups by abolishing untouchability and instituting reservations for Scheduled Castes and Tribes.

Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Delhi Sultans' (specifically Iltutmish, Khaljis, and Tughluqs) approach to appointing administrators and maintaining control differ from Akbar's administrative system, particularly regarding the sources of loyalty and potential for instability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The Delhi Sultans, starting with Iltutmish, favored 'bandagan' (special slaves purchased for military service) and later, the Khaljis and Tughluqs also raised 'people of humble birth' and 'clients' to high political positions like generals and governors. The text states these individuals were 'totally dependent upon their master' and thus the Sultan could 'trust and rely upon them.' However, this system introduced 'an element of political instability' because 'Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs.' This often led to 'conflict between the old and the new nobility' upon a new monarch's accession, and elites criticized the appointment of the 'low and base-born.'\n\nIn contrast, Akbar's administrative system divided the empire into 'subas' (provinces) governed by 'subadars' who performed both political and military functions, supported by other officers like 'diwan,' 'bakhshi,' 'sadr,' 'faujdars,' and 'kotwal.' Akbar's system relied on 'nobles' who 'commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue.' While initially loyal, the text indicates that 'by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own,' and their 'loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest.'\n\nTherefore, the Delhi Sultans' approach focused on personal dependency for loyalty from 'bandagan' and clients, which inherently caused instability upon a change of ruler due to a lack of inherited loyalty. Akbar's system, while more structured with designated roles and powerful nobles, faced instability from the gradual erosion of loyalty among powerful nobles who developed independent interests over time.\n\nAnswer: The Delhi Sultans, particularly Iltutmish, Khaljis, and Tughluqs, appointed 'bandagan' (special slaves) and people of humble birth/clients to high administrative posts. Their loyalty stemmed from personal dependence on their master, leading to political instability as this loyalty did not extend to the Sultan's heirs, causing conflict upon new accessions. In contrast, Akbar's system relied on a structured hierarchy of 'subadars' and 'nobles' who commanded armies and revenues. While initially loyal, the stability of Akbar's system was later threatened as nobles developed independent networks and their loyalties weakened due to self-interest by the late seventeenth century."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.3.4", "7.4.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns.

In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: The Delhi Sultanate faced significant challenges, including the need to maintain large standing armies and external threats like the Mongols. Based on the provided text, describe the distinct administrative and economic strategies employed by Sultan Alauddin Khalji and Sultan Muhammad Tughluq to address these challenges, and also briefly mention how revenue was generally collected under the Delhi Sultanate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires a comparison of administrative and economic strategies of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq, along with a general overview of Delhi Sultanate revenue collection, all based on the provided text. \n\n1.  **Common Challenge:** Both sultans faced increased Mongol attacks and needed to mobilize large standing armies, posing a huge administrative challenge.\n\n2.  **Alauddin Khalji's Strategies:**\n    *   **Garrison Town:** He constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers.\n    *   **Feeding the Army:** Soldiers were fed through produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna, fixed at 50% of the peasant\u2019s yield.\n    *   **Paying the Army:** He paid soldiers cash salaries instead of iqtas. To prevent merchants from raising prices due to increased demand, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were surveyed by officers, and non-compliant merchants were punished. \n    *   **Outcome:** His measures were successful, leading to cheap prices, efficient supplies, and successfully withstanding Mongol invasions.\n\n3.  **Muhammad Tughluq's Strategies:**\n    *   **Initial Context:** He defeated the Mongol army in the early years of his reign and planned an attack on Transoxiana, leading him to raise a large standing army.\n    *   **Garrison Town:** Instead of a new town, he emptied Dehli-i Kuhna (the oldest of Delhi's four cities) of its residents, who were sent to Daulatabad, and garrisoned soldiers there.\n    *   **Feeding the Army:** Produce from the same Ganga-Yamuna area was collected as tax, but additional taxes were levied to meet expenses, coinciding with a famine.\n    *   **Paying the Army:** He also paid soldiers cash salaries but introduced a 'token' currency made of cheap metals. \n    *   **Outcome:** This token currency was not trusted; people saved gold/silver and paid taxes with the cheap tokens, which were also easily counterfeited. His measures were a failure, leading to a disastrous campaign, abandonment of invasion plans, disbanding of the army, resentment over the Daulatabad shift, widespread rebellion due to taxes and famine, and the recall of the token currency.\n\n4.  **General Revenue Collection under Delhi Sultanate:**\n    *   Military commanders (muqtis/iqtadars) collected revenues from their assigned territories (iqtas) as salary and paid their soldiers from these. The state appointed accountants to check revenue collection by muqtis and ensure they collected only prescribed taxes and maintained the required soldiers.\n    *   Under Alauddin Khalji, the state brought land revenue assessment and collection under its own control, cancelling local chieftains' rights to levy taxes and forcing them to pay taxes. Administrators measured land and kept accounts.\n    *   There were three types of taxes: kharaj (on cultivation, about 50% of produce), on cattle, and on houses.\n\nAnswer: Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq employed distinct strategies to manage their large standing armies and external threats. Alauddin Khalji constructed a new garrison town called Siri, fed his army with 50% of peasant's produce as tax from the Ganga-Yamuna region, and paid cash salaries while controlling market prices in Delhi to ensure supplies and prevent inflation. His measures were successful in maintaining cheap prices and repelling Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq, after defeating the Mongols, planned an offensive. He garrisoned his army in Dehli-i Kuhna, displacing its residents to Daulatabad. He levied additional taxes on top of existing ones from the Ganga-Yamuna belt, which coincided with a famine. He also paid cash salaries but introduced a 'token' currency made of cheap metals, which was distrusted, easily counterfeited, and led to people saving gold/silver while paying taxes with the tokens. His administrative measures were a failure, leading to rebellion and the recall of the token currency.\n\nGenerally, under the Delhi Sultanate, revenue was collected by military commanders (muqtis) from their iqtas, who used it as salary and to pay their soldiers. The state appointed accountants to monitor these collections. Alauddin Khalji further centralized revenue collection, cancelling local chieftains' tax-levying rights and imposing three main taxes: kharaj (50% on cultivation), on cattle, and on houses."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.4", "6.5.9", "7.3.4", "7.4.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together. There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago. He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nPaper has become a part of our daily lives.

He beat plant fibres, cloth, rope and the bark of trees, soaked these in water, and then pressed, drained and dried the pulp to create paper. Even today, hand made paper is made through a similar process. \nThe technique of making paper was a closely guarded secret for centuries. It reached Korea about 1400 years ago, and spread to Japan soon after. It was known in Baghdad about 1800 years ago.

If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what methods did the early Indian National Congress utilize to raise public awareness about British rule, and how did a figure like Dadabhai Naoroji, identified as a 'publicist,' embody these efforts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of Indian affairs. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a council to advise him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. Through these measures the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India. \n2. All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as subordinates of the British Crown. \n3. It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4. The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British believed that they were responsible for the rebellion in a big way. \n 5. The British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India. \n 6. Policies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and give them security of rights over their lands. \n Thus a new phase of history began after 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the major administrative and political changes introduced by the British in India after they regained control by the end of 1859?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about the administrative and political changes introduced by the British in India after 1859.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHindu The word \u2018Hindu\u2019, like the term \u2018India\u2019 is derived from the river Indus. It was used by Arabs and Iranians to refer to people who lived to the east of the river, and to their cultural practices, including religious beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what specific actions by the English were perceived as threats to the religious practices of Hindus and Muslims by sepoys, and what is the etymological origin of the term 'Hindu'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text, 'Through the Eyes of the People,' details the perceptions of sepoys regarding British rule.

As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n3 Ruling the Countryside \n\n The Company Becomes the Diwan \n On 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUnlike taxes, which were collected on a regular basis, tribute was collected as and when it was possible from people who gave a variety of things, more or less willingly. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's approach to revenue collection evolve after acquiring the Diwani of Bengal, and what were the major outcomes of these changes for the local population?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The East India Company's approach to revenue collection evolved significantly after it became the Diwan of Bengal on August 12, 1765. Initially, the Company aimed to maximize revenue to finance its purchases of goods, which led to a severe economic crisis in Bengal, including a famine in 1770, as peasants struggled to pay dues and artisans were forced to sell goods at low prices. \n\nTo address this, the Company introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. This system recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars, tasking them with collecting rent and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. The desired outcome was a regular revenue flow and zamindar investment in land improvement. However, the high fixed revenue often caused zamindars to lose their lands, and they often did not invest, while cultivators found the system oppressive due to high rents and insecure land rights.\n\nLater, new systems were devised. In 1822, Holt Mackenzie introduced the Mahalwari Settlement in the North Western Provinces, where revenue was estimated per village (mahal), revised periodically, and collected by the village headman instead of zamindars. Concurrently, in South India, Captain Alexander Read and Thomas Munro developed the Ryotwari (or Munro) system, which involved direct settlements with cultivators (ryots) after surveying their fields individually. \n\nDespite the different approaches, the overall outcome of these new systems was often negative. Driven by the desire for increased income, revenue officials fixed excessively high demands. This resulted in peasants being unable to pay, ryots fleeing the countryside, and many villages becoming deserted.\n\nAnswer: After acquiring the Diwani of Bengal in 1765, the East India Company initially focused on maximizing revenue for trade, leading to an economic crisis and famine in 1770. This prompted the introduction of the Permanent Settlement in 1793, which fixed revenue permanently with zamindars but often led to high rents for cultivators and little investment from zamindars. Subsequently, the Mahalwari Settlement (1822) was introduced in the North Western Provinces, assessing revenue per village, and the Ryotwari System was implemented in the South, making direct settlements with cultivators. A common outcome of these evolving systems was excessively high revenue demands, causing peasants to be unable to pay, ryots to flee, and villages to become deserted."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.4", "7.4.10", "8.3.3", "8.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster.

Let us look at some of these. \nKalidasa is known for his plays depicting life in the king\u2019s court. An interesting feature about these plays is that the king and most brahmins are shown as speaking Sanskrit, while women and men other than the king and brahmins use Prakrit. His most famous play, Abhijnana Shakuntalam, is the story of the love between a king named Dushyanta and a young woman named Shakuntala. We find an interesting description of the plight of a poor fisherman in this play. \nThe Chinese pilgrim Fa Xian noticed the plight of those who were treated as untouchables by the high and mighty. They were expected to live on the outskirts of the city. He writes: \u201cIf such a man enters a town or a market place, he strikes a piece of wood, in order to keep himself separate; people, hearing this sound, know what it means and avoid touching him or brushing against him.\u201d \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHow Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives? \n\n The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIndian Textiles and the World Market \n\n Let us first look at textile production. Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nMost prashastis also mention the ancestors of the ruler. This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full of learned people, including Kalidasa the poet, and Aryabhata the astronomer, about whom you will read more in Chapter 12. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the various ways British colonial rule impacted the livelihoods of Indian weavers and spinners, and similarly, how it altered the traditional lives and economic activities of tribal communities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought will first address the impact on Indian weavers and spinners, drawing information from the 'Indian Textiles and the World Market' section. It will detail the initial dominance of Indian textiles, the subsequent British protective measures like the Calico Act, the imposition of high duties, and the competition from British-made goods, which led to widespread unemployment for Indian weavers and spinners. It will also mention the alternative livelihoods sought by these groups and the eventual rise of Indian cotton mills. Next, the chain of thought will focus on the tribal communities, using information from the 'How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?' section. It will explain how tribal chiefs lost administrative power, how shifting cultivators were pressured to settle, the impact of new forest laws restricting traditional practices, and how traders and moneylenders exploited tribal groups. Finally, it will cover the forced migration of tribals to plantations and mines for meager wages, showcasing the significant disruption to their traditional lives.\n\nAnswer: British colonial rule profoundly impacted the livelihoods of both Indian weavers/spinners and tribal communities. For weavers and spinners, India, initially the world's largest producer of cotton textiles, faced severe decline. European demand for Indian textiles led to a flourishing trade, but by the early eighteenth century, England's wool and silk makers protested, leading to the 1720 Calico Act, which banned printed Indian cotton textiles in England. High duties were imposed on Indian textiles, making exports difficult, and British-made cotton textiles eventually ousted Indian goods from traditional markets. This resulted in thousands of weavers and spinners losing their livelihoods; many became agricultural laborers, migrated to cities or plantations abroad, or later found work in new Indian cotton mills established from 1854 onwards. \n\nSimilarly, tribal communities experienced drastic changes. Tribal chiefs lost much of their administrative power and had to pay tribute to the British. Shifting cultivators were pressured to settle down, and land settlements were introduced, which often led to poor yields for jhum cultivators in dry areas. New forest laws declared forests as state property, restricting jhum cultivation, fruit collection, and hunting, forcing many tribals to seek work elsewhere. Traders and moneylenders exploited tribal groups, particularly silk growers, paying them meager amounts for cocoons sold at five times the price. Many tribals were recruited through contractors to work in tea plantations and coal mines, receiving miserably low wages and being prevented from returning home."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.11.6", "8.6.2", "8.4.3", "6.11.4", "6.11.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

He was a kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha, about which you read in Chapter 6. At the age of thirty, he left home and went to live in a forest. For twelve years he led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment. \nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes. They must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings. \u201cAll beings,\u201d said Mahavira \u201clong to live. To all things life is dear.\u201d Ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers, because they used Prakrit. There were several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of the country, and named after the regions in which they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken in Magadha was known as Magadhi. \nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and were especially asked not to steal. Also, they had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up everything, including their clothes. \nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands left their homes to learn and teach this new way of life. Many more remained behind and supported those who became monks and nuns, providing them with food. \nJainism was supported mainly by traders. Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and his followers were transmitted orally for several centuries. They were written down in the form in which they are presently available at a place called Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see Map 7, page 113). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Rome on Map 6 (page 84). This is one of the oldest cities in Europe, and developed around the same time as the cities in the Ganga valley. Rome was the capital of one of the largest empires \u2014 one that spread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Augustus, one of the most important emperors, who ruled about 2000 years ago, said that he found Rome a city of brick, and made it into a city of marble. He, and later rulers, built temples and palaces. \nThey also built huge amphitheatres \u2014 open arenas surrounded by tiers of seats \u2014 where citizens could watch all kinds of shows, and public baths (with separate timings for men and women), where people met and relaxed.

Let us look at the example of Mathura (Map 7, page 113). \nMathura has been an important settlement for more than 2500 years. It was important because it was located at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south. There were fortifications around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food for people in the city. Mathura was also a centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced. \nAround 2000 years ago Mathura became the second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you will be reading in Chapter 10. Mathura was also a religious centre \u2014 there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and it was an important centre for the worship of Krishna.ks \nmoSeveral inscriptions on surfaces such as stone slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to monasteries and shrines.

For instance, inscriptions from Mathura mention goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers.ks \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary purposes of the public structures built in ancient Rome, and what factors contributed to Mathura's significance as a settlement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes the primary purposes of public structures in ancient Rome.

The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \nBy 1857 the Company came to exercise direct rule over about 83 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the primary governing authorities and key societal roles in the Harappan and Later Vedic periods, and explain how the East India Company's role in India evolved by 1857."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for three distinct pieces of information from the provided texts. \n1.

Many of these were inscribed several hundreds of years ago. All inscriptions contain both scripts and languages. Languages which were used, as well as scripts, have changed over time. So how do scholars understand what was inscribed? This can be done through a process known as decipherment \nOne of the most famous stories of decipherment comes from Egypt, a country in north Africa where there were kings and queens about 5000 years ago. \nRosetta is a town on the north coast of Egypt, and here an inscribed stone was found, which contained inscriptions in three different languages and scripts (Greek, and two forms of Egyptian). Scholars who could read Greek figured out that the names of kings and queens were enclosed in a little frame, called a cartouche. They then placed the Greek and the Egyptian signs side by side, and identified the sounds for which the Egyptian letters stood. As you can see, a lion stood for L, and a bird for A.

Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAround the time when Jainism and Buddhism were becoming popular, brahmins developed the system of ashramas. Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found seeds of wheat, barley, rice, pulses, millets, peas and sesame. Bones of a number of animals, many bearing cut marks that show they may have been used as food, have also been found. These include cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, dog, horse, ass, pig, sambhar, spotted deer, blackbuck, antelope, hare, and mongoose, besides birds, crocodile, turtle, crab and fish. There is evidence that fruits such as ber, amla, jamun, dates and a variety of berries were collected. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the British Company's reforms to vernacular education after 1854 impact the accessibility of schooling for children from poor peasant families, in contrast to the earlier pathshala system described by William Adam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text first describes the pre-British pathshala system, noting its flexibility, including classes not being held during harvest time. This flexibility meant that 'even children of peasant families could study.' (from 'What Happened to the Local Schools?' section). After 1854, the British Company introduced 'new routines, new rules' to vernacular education, which included demanding 'regular attendance' and a 'regular timetable.' The text explicitly states that 'The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields.' Consequently, 'Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn.' This indicates that the new, rigid system significantly reduced the accessibility of education for poor peasant children, who could no longer balance schooling with their necessary labor during harvest, unlike the earlier flexible system.\n\nAnswer: The British Company's reforms after 1854, which introduced regular attendance and timetables, negatively impacted the accessibility of schooling for children from poor peasant families. The earlier pathshala system was flexible, allowing children to work in the fields during harvest and still attend school. However, the new system's demand for regular attendance, even during harvest time, meant that poor children who had to work were unable to attend, and their absence was viewed as indiscipline, thereby making education less accessible to them."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.7.9", "6.2.4", "6.5.10", "8.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed.

At that time a new international body \u2013 the United Nations \u2013 formed in 1945 was in its infancy.The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of the Cold War, that is, power rivalries and ideological conflicts between the USA and the USSR, with both countries creating military alliances. This was also the period when colonial empires were collapsing and many countries were attaining independence. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was also the foreign minister of newly independent India, developed free India\u2019s foreign policy in this context. Non-alignment formed the bedrock of this foreign policy. \nLed by statesmen from Egypt, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Ghana and India, the non-aligned movement urged countries not to join either of the two major alliances. But this policy of staying away from alliances was not a matter of remaining \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d. The former means remaining aloof from world affairs whereas non-aligned countries such as India played an active role in mediating between the American and Soviet alliances. They tried to prevent war \u2014 often taking a humanitarian and moral stand against war. However, for one reason or another, many non-aligned countries including India got involved in wars.

They were obligated to 'bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support'. It also notes that as they gained 'power and wealth', they would declare themselves 'maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara' and 'sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords'. The example of Dantidurga overthrowing his Chalukya overlord and performing the 'hiranya-garbha' ritual is provided as an instance of asserting independence.\n2.  **For the urban planning and architectural elements (Section 3):** The text describes ancient cities as often divided into 'two or more parts': a 'smaller but higher' western part called the 'citadel' and a 'larger but lower' eastern part called the 'lower town'.

In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago.

They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFa Xian began his journey back home from Bengal.

The merchants began throwing their merchandise overboard so as to lighten the load and save the ship from sinking. Fa Xian threw away his meagre personal belongings, but clung to his books and the statues of the Buddha that he had collected. Finally, the storm subsided after 13 days. This is how he describes the sea: \u201cThe sea itself is boundless in extent \u2014 it is impossible to know east or west, except by observing the sun, moon, or stars in their motions. If it is dark, rainy weather, the only plan is to steer by the wind.\u201d It took him more than 90 days to reach Java, where he halted for five months, before boarding another merchant ship that took him to China. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle, children (especially sons), and horses. Horses were yoked to chariots that were used in battles, which were fought to capture cattle. Battles were also fought for land, which was important for pasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened quickly, such as barley. Some battles were fought for water, and to capture people. \nSome of the wealth that was obtained was kept by the leaders, some was given to the priests and the rest was distributed amongst the people. Some wealth was used for the performance of yajnas or sacrifices in which offerings were made into the fire. These were meant for gods and goddesses. Offerings could include ghee, grain, and in some cases, animals. \nMost men took part in these wars. There was no regular army, but there were assemblies where people met and discussed matters of war and peace. They also chose leaders, who were often brave and skilful warriors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the primary methods used by various rulers, such as Rajarajadeva, Muslim Sultans, and Akbar, to demonstrate their power, wealth, and legitimacy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

All three states were founded by members of the high Mughal nobility who had been governors of large provinces \u2013 Sa\u2018adat Khan (Awadh), Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad). All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both Asaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Sa\u2018adat Khan\u2019s zat was 6,000. \nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state (1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had already gained control over its political and financial administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the actual ruler of that region. \nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. \nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2). \nA description of the Nizam of Hyderabad\u2019s personal troopers in 1790: \u2026The Nizam has a swaree (sawari) of 400 elephants, several thousand of horsemen near his person who receive upwards 100 R(upees)s nominal pay (and) are extremely well mounted and richly caparisoned \nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire. Awadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. In other words, he was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh. \nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawab\u2019s court. He seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand. \nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past. \nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Like the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars. \nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenthcentury Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars. The close connection between the state and bankers \u2013 noticeable in Hyderabad and Awadh as well \u2013 was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756). During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous. \nIf we take a bird\u2019s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states. First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably. The third common feature in all these regional states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nYou may have noticed how wealth is measured in terms of coins in the story on page 90. Archaeologists have found several thousands of coins belonging to this period. The earliest coins which were in use for about 500 years were punch marked coins, \nPunch-marked coins were generally rectangular or sometimes square or round in shape, either cut out of metal sheets or made out of flattened metal globules (a small spherical body). The coins were not inscribed, but were stamped with symbols using dies or punches. Hence, they are called punch-marked coins. These coins are found over most parts of the subcontinent and remained in circulation till the early centuries CE. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were two major changes in agriculture around this time. One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the administrative strategies employed by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq in response to the Mongol threat and for managing their large armies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text in the third section provides distinct administrative measures taken by both Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq concerning the Mongol threat and army management.\n2. For Alauddin Khalji, the text states he 'constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers'. To feed them, 'produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna' was used, with 'Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield'. He 'chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash' and to prevent inflation, 'Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi', punishing non-compliant merchants. His measures were 'quite successful' and he 'successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions'.\n3. For Muhammad Tughluq, the text indicates he 'raised a large standing army' after an initial Mongol defeat, with plans for an offensive. Instead of a new town, 'the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there', sending residents to Daulatabad. 'Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army', but he 'levied additional taxes', coinciding with a famine. He also 'paid his soldiers cash salaries' but 'used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency' made of cheap metals, which 'People in the fourteenth century did not trust' and which 'could also be counterfeited easily'. His measures 'were a failure', leading to resentment, rebellion, and the recall of the token currency. The text also highlights that Tughluq's measures were 'conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols', unlike Alauddin's defensive ones.\n4. The comparison reveals differences in housing soldiers (new town vs. emptying old city), tax collection (fixed vs. additional during famine), currency policy (price control vs. token currency), and the overall outcome (successful defense vs. failed offensive and administrative complications).\n\nAnswer: Alauddin Khalji responded to the Mongol threat by constructing a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. He fed his army by collecting tax, fixed at 50 percent of the peasant\u2019s yield, from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. He paid his soldiers cash salaries and prevented price inflation by controlling the prices of goods in Delhi, punishing merchants who did not comply. His measures were successful in withstanding Mongol invasions.\n\nIn contrast, Muhammad Tughluq, after an initial Mongol defeat, raised a large standing army with an offensive plan. He housed his soldiers by emptying the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) and relocating its residents to Daulatabad. He collected produce as tax from the same area to feed the army but levied additional taxes, which coincided with a famine. He also paid cash salaries but introduced a 'token' currency made of cheap metals, which was distrusted and easily counterfeited. Muhammad Tughluq's administrative measures were largely a failure, leading to widespread rebellion, resentment, and the recall of the token currency."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.9.6", "6.12.3", "7.3.4", "7.10.4", "6.6.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMercantile \u2013 A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices \nEast India Company Comes East \n\n In 1800, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAround 3500 years ago, we find some of the first evidence of writing in China. \nThese writings were on animal bones. These are called oracle bones, because they were used to predict the future. Kings got scribes to write questions on the bones \u2014 would they win battles? Would the harvest be good? Would they have sons? The bones were then put into the fire, and they cracked because of the heat. Then fortunetellers studied these cracks, and tried to predict the future. As you may expect, they sometimes made mistakes. \nThese kings lived in palaces in cities. They amassed vast quantities of wealth, including large, elaborately decorated bronze vessels. However, they did not know the use of iron. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's evolving strategy, from primarily trade to integrating political and administrative control, contribute to the decline of Masulipatnam as a significant port?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text indicates that Masulipatnam was a crucial and active port in the seventeenth century, with both the Dutch and English East India Companies vying for control. However, the Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda tried to limit European control through royal monopolies, and competition was intense among various trading groups. Following the Mughal annexation of Golconda in 1686-1687, European Companies began searching for alternative trade locations. The English East India Company then adopted a 'new policy' where its trade centers were expected to combine political, administrative, and commercial functions, moving beyond merely having access to production centers. This strategic shift, driven by the Company's increasing involvement in political affairs (as evidenced by its actions in Bengal, such as fortifying settlements, acquiring zamindari rights, and eventually gaining the Diwani after events like the Battle of Plassey, allowing it to use local revenues to finance its trade and military), meant that ports like Masulipatnam, which did not offer such integrated control, became less appealing. Consequently, the Company's traders relocated to centers like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, which were being developed to serve these combined political, administrative, and commercial roles, directly causing Masulipatnam to lose its merchants and prosperity and decline during the eighteenth century.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company's strategic shift to integrate political and administrative control with commercial roles, particularly after the Mughal annexation of Golconda, led it to abandon Masulipatnam. The Company sought new centers like Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras where it could establish comprehensive control, thereby diverting trade and merchants away from Masulipatnam and causing its decline."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.2.2", "6.5.11", "7.6.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period. At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction. Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the evolution of British educational policy in India from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, highlighting the key debates and policy shifts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The evolution of British educational policy in India can be traced through several phases as detailed in the 'Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation' section. \n\n1.  **Late 18th Century - Orientalism:** Initially, figures like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, and Nathaniel Halhed, known as Orientalists, held a deep respect for ancient Indian culture. They believed Indian civilization had declined and sought to revive it by discovering, studying, and translating ancient Indian texts (Sanskrit and Persian). Their aim was to help the British learn from Indian culture and for Indians to rediscover their heritage. This led to the establishment of institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781 to promote Arabic, Persian, and Islamic law, and the Hindu College in Benaras in 1791 for ancient Sanskrit texts. They felt the British should promote Indian learning, not Western, to win the hearts of the 'natives'.\n\n2.  **Early 19th Century - Criticism of Orientalism:** From the early 19th century, a shift occurred. Critics like James Mill argued that Eastern knowledge was full of errors, unscientific, and impractical. He advocated that British education should focus on teaching what was useful and practical, specifically Western scientific and technical advances, rather than Eastern poetry or sacred literature.\n\n3.  **1830s - Macaulay's Influence and English Education Act:** The criticism intensified by the 1830s with Thomas Babington Macaulay being a prominent voice. He viewed India as uncivilised and believed Eastern knowledge was vastly inferior to European learning. Macaulay strongly advocated for teaching the English language, arguing it would allow Indians access to world literature, Western science, and philosophy, thereby 'civilising' them. His 'minute' led to the **English Education Act of 1835**. This act made English the medium of instruction for higher education and stopped the promotion of Oriental institutions, which were now seen as 'temples of darkness'.\n\n4.  **Mid-19th Century - Wood's Despatch (1854) and Commercial Focus:** The policy was further shaped by Wood's Despatch in 1854. Issued by Charles Wood, it re-emphasized the practical benefits of European learning. A key aspect was economic: European education would help Indians understand the advantages of trade and commerce, develop the country's resources, and by changing their tastes, create demand for British goods. This period saw the establishment of education departments and universities in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay in 1857.\n\n5.  **Parallel Debate - Missionary Education:** Simultaneously, Christian missionaries argued for moral education through Christianity, believing it would improve people's character. However, the East India Company initially opposed this, fearing it would provoke local reaction. After 1857, the British government also remained reluctant to directly support missionary education to avoid offending 'native' opinion.\n\nIn summary, British educational policy evolved from a respectful promotion of ancient Indian learning (Orientalism) to a strong condemnation of it in favor of practical Western knowledge and English language instruction (Macaulay and English Education Act), finally settling on a policy that also explicitly linked European education to economic and commercial benefits for the British Empire (Wood's Despatch).\n\nAnswer: British educational policy in India evolved through distinct phases from the late 18th to the mid-19th century. Initially, Orientalists like William Jones (late 18th century) advocated for the study and promotion of ancient Indian texts and languages (Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic), establishing institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa (1781) and Hindu College Benaras (1791) out of respect for India's past glory. However, by the early 19th century, critics like James Mill began to argue against Oriental learning, deeming it unscientific and impractical, advocating instead for useful Western knowledge. This criticism intensified with Thomas Babington Macaulay in the 1830s, who vehemently asserted the superiority of Western knowledge and the English language. His influence led to the English Education Act of 1835, which made English the medium of instruction for higher education and ceased support for Oriental institutions. Finally, Wood's Despatch in 1854 further solidified European learning, emphasizing its practical and economic benefits, such as promoting trade and creating demand for British goods, leading to the establishment of education departments and universities."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.1.4", "6.7.9", "8.7.1", "7.5.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today. Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the European companies within these new cities. The \u201cblacks\u201d or native traders and craftspersons were confined here while the \u201cwhite\u201d rulers occupied the superior residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St. William in Calcutta.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were at least three different kinds of people living in most villages in the southern and northern parts of the subcontinent. In the Tamil region, large landowners were known as vellalar, ordinary ploughmen were known as uzhavar, and landless labourers, including slaves, were known as kadaisiyar and adimai. \nIn the northern part of the country, the village headman was known as the grama bhojaka. Usually, men from the same family held the position for generations. In other words, the post was hereditary. The grama bhojaka was often the largest landowner. Generally, he had slaves and hired workers to cultivate the land. Besides, as he was powerful, the king often used him to collect taxes from the village. He also functioned as a judge, and sometimes as a policeman. \nApart from the gramabhojaka, there were other independent farmers, known as grihapatis, most of whom were smaller landowners. And then there were men and women such as the dasa karmakara, who did not own land, and had to earn a living working on the fields owned by others. \nIn most villages there were also some crafts persons such as the blacksmith, potter, carpenter and weaver. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did various groups and individuals, including tribal people, samantas, and those with administrative or local influence, contribute to the evolution of political power and administrative structures in the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The texts provide multiple examples of how power dynamics evolved. \n2. Section 1 states that some tribal people established extensive states with well-organised administration, becoming politically powerful and entering into conflict with larger kingdoms. This shows a direct contribution to the formation of new political entities.\n3. Section 2 describes the rise of 'samantas' (landlords/warrior chiefs) who, initially subordinates, gained power and wealth, eventually declaring independence and establishing their own authority, sometimes even overthrowing their overlords (e.g., the Rashtrakutas). It also mentions men from enterprising families, like the Brahmanas Kadamba Mayurasharman and Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra, who used military skills to carve out kingdoms, demonstrating another path to political power.\n4. Section 4 highlights changes in administration where important posts became hereditary (e.g., Harishena as maha-danda-nayaka like his father) and individuals often held multiple offices. Furthermore, influential local figures such as the nagarashreshthi (chief banker), sarthavaha (leader of merchant caravans), prathama-kulika (chief craftsman), and head of the kayasthas (scribes) gained a say in local administration, with some growing powerful enough to set up independent kingdoms.\n5. Section 3 illustrates village-level power through the 'grama bhojaka' in northern India. This hereditary village headman was often the largest landowner, collected taxes for the king, and acted as a judge and policeman, thereby holding significant administrative and political authority at the local level.\n6. These examples collectively demonstrate how different groups and individuals contributed to the dynamic evolution of political power and administrative structures, from the formation of independent states to the exercise of authority within villages.\n\nAnswer: Various groups and individuals significantly shaped the evolving political and administrative structures. Some tribal people established extensive states with well-organised administrations, becoming politically powerful and clashing with larger kingdoms. Samantas, initially subordinates, accumulated wealth and power, asserting independence from their overlords and sometimes founding new kingdoms, as did enterprising individuals like the Brahmanas Kadamba Mayurasharman and Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra, who used military skills to create states. Administrative posts became hereditary, and influential local men, such as chief bankers, merchant leaders, chief craftsmen, and scribes, gained a say in local administration, with some eventually establishing independent kingdoms. At the village level, the grama bhojaka, a powerful and often hereditary headman, served as the largest landowner, tax collector, judge, and policeman, exerting considerable local administrative and political authority."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.7", "7.2.1", "6.9.3", "6.11.7", "6.2.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Bengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist monasteries) depict scenes of fish being dressed and taken to the market in baskets. \nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat nonvegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for the Bengal Brahmanas. The Brihaddharma Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the administrative measures taken by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq to address the challenges posed by the Mongol threat, highlighting the outcomes of their respective strategies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify the common challenge:** Both Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq faced the significant administrative challenge of maintaining a large standing army due to Mongol invasions or the threat thereof.

The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThis was also the time when Aryabhata, a mathematician and astronomer, wrote a book in Sanskrit known as the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis, even though it seems as if the sun is rising and setting everyday.

These six systems of philosophy are said to have been founded by sages Konada, Gotama, Kapila, Patanjali, Jaimini and Vyasa, respectively. These philosophies still guide scholarly discourse in the country.

Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago.

The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen that the earliest people hunted, gathered plant produce, made stone tools, and painted on cave walls. Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLarge states like those of the Cholas (Chapter 2), Tughluqs (Chapter 3) or Mughals (Chapter 4) encompassed many regions. A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that are similar and circle those that are different. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nNomadic pastoralists moved over long distances with their animals. They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were some of the key interactions and impacts of the Mughal Empire on different groups and regions within the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

Let us see how they study the Rigveda. \nSome of the hymns in the Rigveda are in the form of dialogues. This is part of one such hymn, a dialogue between a sage named Vishvamitra, and two rivers, (Beas and Sutlej) that were worshipped as goddesses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nVery often, a single town was important for a variety of reasons. Let us look at the example of Mathura (Map 7, page 113). \nMathura has been an important settlement for more than 2500 years. It was important because it was located at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south. There were fortifications around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food for people in the city. Mathura was also a centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced. \nAround 2000 years ago Mathura became the second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you will be reading in Chapter 10. Mathura was also a religious centre \u2014 there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and it was an important centre for the worship of Krishna.ks \nmoSeveral inscriptions on surfaces such as stone slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to monasteries and shrines. These were made by kings and queens, officers, merchants, and crafts persons who lived in the city. For instance, inscriptions from Mathura mention goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers.ks \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe lions that we see on our notes and coins have a long history. They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary reasons for the importance of cities within Ashoka's empire like Taxila and Ujjain, and how did Mathura's significance compare? Additionally, what evidence of specialized crafts and professions is mentioned for cities in Ashoka's empire, Mathura, and Harappan cities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought begins by identifying the reasons for the importance of cities in Ashoka's empire. The first text states that Taxila was a 'gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia,' and Ujjain 'lay on the route from north to south India,' indicating their strategic locations for trade and travel. For Ashoka's empire cities, the text also mentions 'Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities.'\n\nNext, the focus shifts to Mathura. The second text explains Mathura's diverse importance: it was an 'important settlement for more than 2500 years' due to its location 'at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south.' It also had 'fortifications,' 'several shrines,' was a 'centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced,' became the 'second capital of the Kushanas,' and was a 'religious centre' with Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and a center for Krishna worship. Inscriptions from Mathura specifically mention 'goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers' as professions.\n\nFinally, for Harappan cities, the fourth text details various crafts. Objects found include tools, weapons, ornaments, and vessels made of copper, bronze, gold, and silver. Other striking finds were 'beads, weights, and blades.' Harappans also made 'seals out of stone' with animal carvings and 'pots with beautiful black designs.' The text explicitly states that 'Cotton was probably grown' and 'actual pieces of cloth were found,' along with 'spindle whorls' used to spin thread. It highlights the presence of 'specialists' trained for 'cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals,' indicating a range of specialized crafts.\n\nAnswer: Cities like Taxila and Ujjain within Ashoka's empire were important primarily due to their strategic geographical locations; Taxila served as a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain was situated on a major route from north to south India. In contrast, Mathura's significance was multifaceted and long-standing, being important for over 2500 years due to its location at the crossroads of two major trade routes (northwest to east and north to south), its fortifications, numerous shrines, production of fine sculpture, its role as the second capital of the Kushanas, and its status as a religious center for Buddhist, Jaina, and Krishna worship.\n\nRegarding specialized crafts and professions:\n-   **Ashoka's empire cities:** Merchants, officials, and general crafts persons are mentioned as residents.\n-   **Mathura:** Inscriptions record gifts made by specific professionals such as goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, and perfumers, in addition to sculptors implied by the production of fine sculpture.\n-   **Harappan cities:** Evidence suggests specialized craft production including tools, weapons, ornaments, and vessels from stone, shell, copper, bronze, gold, and silver. Other crafts include the making of beads, weights, blades, stone seals with animal carvings, pottery with black designs, and textiles (cotton, cloth, and spindle whorls for spinning thread), with explicit mention of 'specialists' for tasks like cutting stone, polishing beads, or carving seals."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.1", "6.9.7", "7.2.1", "6.4.5", "6.5.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the methods used by the Muvendar to acquire wealth, and which two of their power centers were considered most important?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that the Muvendar, identified as the 'three chiefs,' did not collect regular taxes.

Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe thousand years of history that we are exploring witnessed major developments in religious traditions. People\u2019s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective belief in a supernatural agency \u2013 religion \u2013 was often closely connected with the social and economic organisation of local communities. As the social worlds of these groups altered so too did their beliefs. \nIt was during this period that important changes occurred in what we call Hinduism today. These included the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty and the growing importance of Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society. Their knowledge of Sanskrit texts earned the Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant position was consolidated by the support of their patrons \u2013 new rulers searching for prestige. \nOne of the major developments of this period was the emergence of the idea of bhakti \u2013 of a loving, personal deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about this, and other traditions, in Chapter 8. \nThis was also the period when new religions appeared in the subcontinent. Merchants and migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the Quran as their holy book and accept the sovereignty of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard to social background. \nMany rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama \u2013 learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism, Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its followers. There were the Shia Muslims who believed that the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s son-in-law, Ali, was the legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and the Sunni Muslims who accepted the authority of the early leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and the succeeding Khalifas. There were other important differences between the various schools of law (Hanafi and Shafi\u2019i mainly in India), and in theology and mystic traditions. \nPatron - An influential, wealthy individual who supports another person \u2013 an artiste, a craftsperson, a learned man, or a noble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou may have noticed how wealth is measured in terms of coins in the story on page 90. Archaeologists have found several thousands of coins belonging to this period. The earliest coins which were in use for about 500 years were punch marked coins, \nPunch-marked coins were generally rectangular or sometimes square or round in shape, either cut out of metal sheets or made out of flattened metal globules (a small spherical body). The coins were not inscribed, but were stamped with symbols using dies or punches. Hence, they are called punch-marked coins. These coins are found over most parts of the subcontinent and remained in circulation till the early centuries CE. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did colonial policies, new religious developments, and economic systems lead to significant changes in the lives of people and the organization of societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Colonial Policies (Text 1):** The first text details how British colonial rule profoundly changed tribal lives. Tribal chiefs lost administrative power, were forced to follow British laws, pay tribute, and discipline their people on behalf of the British. Shifting cultivators were pressured to settle, and new forest laws restricted their traditional practices, forcing many to migrate or provide labor to the Forest Department under exploitative conditions. This fundamentally altered their traditional governance, livelihoods, and freedom.\n2.  **New Religious Developments (Text 2):** The second text describes major developments in religious traditions over a thousand years. Hinduism saw changes like the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty, and the growing importance of Brahmanas. The emergence of Bhakti offered a more personal path to the divine. The arrival of Islam in the seventh century introduced new beliefs and practices, leading to diverse interpretations (Shia and Sunni) and influencing rulers and societal structures.\n3.  **Economic Systems (Text 1 & 3):** The third text introduces punch-marked coins as an early economic mechanism for measuring wealth, indicating the existence of structured economic systems over centuries. The first text further illustrates how colonial economic systems and practices severely impacted tribal communities. Traders and moneylenders exploited tribal silk growers, paying them meager wages for cocoons sold at much higher prices. Furthermore, tribals were recruited for tea plantations and coal mines under contractors, receiving miserably low wages and being prevented from returning home, which signifies a highly exploitative economic system changing their traditional economic independence.\n\nAnswer: Colonial policies, as seen under British rule, significantly altered tribal governance by reducing chiefs' powers, restricted traditional livelihoods like shifting cultivation through forest laws, and led to severe economic exploitation in trade and labor. New religious developments over a thousand years transformed Hinduism with new deities, temples, and the rise of Brahmanas, alongside the emergence of Bhakti and the introduction of Islam, which brought new beliefs and societal interpretations. Economic systems, exemplified by early currency like punch-marked coins and later by colonial-era exploitative trade and labor practices, fundamentally reshaped how wealth was measured and how communities, particularly tribal groups, sustained their livelihoods and interacted with external markets."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.3", "7.1.6", "6.9.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Kabir's teachings critique the social structure and the role of the priestly class as described for the later Vedic period?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that Kabir\u2019s teachings \"openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system.\" The second text section describes the social structure of the later Vedic period, where \"The priests divided people into four groups, called varnas,\" with the 'brahmin' being the first varna, expected to \"study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts.\" This section also notes that the varna system was based on birth and that 'shudras' and women were not allowed to study the Vedas or perform rituals, and that \"Many people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins\" and condemned untouchability. By rejecting the 'pre-eminence of the priestly classes,' Kabir directly challenged the elevated status and exclusive rights of the brahmins described in the later Vedic period. His rejection of the 'caste system' directly opposed the varna system's hierarchical divisions and restrictions based on birth. Furthermore, Kabir's belief in a 'formless Supreme God' and 'bhakti or devotion' as the 'only path to salvation' contrasted with the ritualistic practices and emphasis on sacrifices performed by the priests in the Vedic tradition.\n\nAnswer: Kabir's teachings critiqued the later Vedic social structure by openly ridiculing the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. This directly challenged the brahmins' top position and exclusive ritualistic roles within the varna system, which divided people by birth and restricted access to knowledge and rituals for groups like shudras and women. Kabir advocated for devotion to a formless Supreme God as the sole path to salvation, contrasting with the ritual-centric practices described for the Vedic priests."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.8.10", "6.6.2", "7.5.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.

One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nYou may have seen people perform rituals of worship, or singing bhajans, kirtans or qawwalis, or even repeating the name of God in silence, and noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations. They were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made.

It states that historians use 'official records of the British administration', including 'memos, notings and reports' preserved in 'record rooms', 'archives and museums'. It also mentions various 'surveys' like revenue, census, botanical, zoological, archaeological, anthropological, and forest surveys. For understanding perspectives beyond official records, it lists 'diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets', as well as 'newspapers', and writings by 'leaders and reformers, poets and novelists'.\n\nThe fourth text section, describing kingdoms after the Mauryan empire, provides sources for an earlier period. It explicitly states, 'We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.'\n\nBy combining information from these two sections, we can identify diverse sources across different historical periods mentioned in the texts.\n\nAnswer: Historians utilize a variety of sources to understand Indian history. For the last 250 years, these include official records of the British administration (such as memos, reports, and preserved documents in record rooms, archives, and museums), and various surveys (like revenue, census, botanical, zoological, archaeological, anthropological, and forest surveys). Additionally, non-official sources like diaries, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies, popular booklets, newspapers, and the writings of leaders, reformers, poets, and novelists are used.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nUsually two to three generations live together in small settlements or villages. Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together.

The second section, 'Through the Eyes of the People,' details these reasons through two sources. Vishnubhatt Godse's account (Source 1) states that sepoys believed the English intended to wipe out the religions of Hindus and Muslims by introducing eighty-four rules, which kings rejected, leading to a planned 'war of religion.' Subedar Sitaram Pande's memoirs (Source 2) add that the seizing of Oudh created distrust among sepoys. Additionally, agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi incited soldiers to mutiny with promises of restoring the Emperor of Delhi. A crucial factor was the report that new rifle cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, which was seen as an attempt to defile both Mahommedans and Hindus, fueling the belief that the English aimed to convert them to Christianity. These elements collectively contributed to the widespread excitement and planning for the uprising.\n\nAnswer: The anticipated 'massive upheaval' against British rule was primarily attributed to the English's perceived determination to wipe out Hindu and Muslim religions through eighty-four rules, the distrust among sepoys caused by the seizing of Oudh, incitement by agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi to restore the Emperor of Delhi, and the belief that new rifle cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, intended to defile religious groups and facilitate conversion to Christianity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.8", "8.5.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe lions that we see on our notes and coins have a long history. They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIndian Textiles and the World Market \n\n Let us first look at textile production. Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nTake a look at Table 1 once again. You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains. But it was difficult to keep this balance all the time. Look at Table 1 again \u2013 note that Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji when he came to accept Mughal authority. What was the consequence of this insult? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal fundamentally alter its trade financing and subsequently contribute to the decline of the traditional Indian textile industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that prior to gaining the Diwani, the East India Company (EIC) faced a significant challenge in financing its trade with India, as it had to import \"gold and silver imported from Britain\" to purchase goods, since \"Britain had no goods to sell in India.\" This situation changed dramatically in 1785 when the \"Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal.\" The Diwani granted the EIC the right to \"use the vast revenue resources of Bengal,\" which solved its major financing problem. The text explicitly states that \"The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.\" \n\nThis shift in financing, while initially allowing the EIC to continue purchasing Indian textiles, was part of a broader context that contributed to the decline of the Indian textile industry. The text highlights that the \"development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways.\" Specifically, \"Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets,\" and \"exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain.\" By the early nineteenth century, \"Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets,\" leading to \"Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment.\" The EIC's agents also \"stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies.\" Thus, the Diwani enabled the EIC to sustain its trade and administrative costs in India without relying on British bullion, simultaneously creating a political and economic environment where British industrial goods, protected by high duties and supported by the Company's power, could outcompete and displace traditional Indian textiles.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company's acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal in 1785 fundamentally altered its trade financing by allowing it to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal to fund its expenses and purchase Indian goods, thereby eliminating the need to import gold and silver from Britain. This shift, combined with the rise of British cotton industries, contributed to the decline of the traditional Indian textile industry as Indian textiles faced competition from cheaper British goods in global markets, high duties when exported to Britain, and reduced demand from the Company, leading to widespread unemployment among Indian weavers."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.1", "7.4.5", "8.2.2", "8.6.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

These were carefully arranged by people, and were used to mark burial sites. The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. \nSome important megalithic sites are shown on Map 2 (page14). While some megaliths can be seen on the surface, other megalithic burials are often underground. \nSometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground. These are the only indications that there are burials beneath. \nThere were several things that people did to make megaliths. We have made a list here. Try and arrange them in the correct order: digging pits in the earth, transporting stones, breaking boulders, placing stones in position, finding suitable stone, shaping stones, burying the dead. \nAll these burials have some common features. Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. Also found are tools and weapons of iron and sometimes, skeletons of horses, horse equipment and ornaments of stone and gold. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the nineteenth century, the region that constitutes most of present-day Rajasthan, was called Rajputana by the British. While this may suggest that this was an area that was inhabited only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. There were (and are) several groups who identify themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and central India. And of course, there are several peoples other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan. \nThese cultural traditions were closely linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. From about the eighth century, most of the present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) was one such ruler. These rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow their example. Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories \u2013 which often depicted dramatic situations, and a range of strong emotions \u2013 loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger, etc. \nDid women find a place within these stories? Sometimes, they figure as the \u201ccause\u201d for conflicts, as men fought with one another to either \u201cwin\u201d or \u201cprotect\u201d women. Women are also depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death \u2013 there are stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay for it with their lives. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou read about the Northern Black Polished Ware in Chapter 9. This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these long journeys. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nMost prashastis also mention the ancestors of the ruler. This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full of learned people, including Kalidasa the poet, and Aryabhata the astronomer, about whom you will read more in Chapter 12. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What are the distinct characteristics and contexts of the two types of pottery mentioned in the provided texts, specifically Black and Red Ware and Northern Black Polished Ware?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that \"Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware,\" placing this pottery type in the context of megalithic burial sites.

From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars. \nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble\u2019s position in court and the larger his salary. \nNobles with a zat of 5,000 were ranked higher than those of 1,000. In Akbar\u2019s reign there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars had increased to 79. \nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary. \nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country. \nIn Akbar\u2019s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb\u2019s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What issues arose within the mansabdar and jagir system during Aurangzeb's reign, and what were the consequences of these developments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that mansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs.

A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers.

There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe have seen in Chapter 2 that the climate of the world was changing, and so were plants and animals that people used as food. Men, women and children probably observed several things: the places where edible plants were found, how seeds broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. Perhaps they began looking after plants \u2014 protecting them from birds and animals so that they could grow and the seeds could ripen. In this way people became farmers. \nWomen, men and children could also attract and then tame animals by leaving food for them near their shelters. The first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that were relatively gentle to come near the camps where they lived. These animals such as sheep, goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and most of them ate grass. Often, people protected these animals from attacks by other wild animals. This is how they became herders. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found traces of huts or houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, which were dug into the ground, with steps leading into them. These may have provided shelter in cold weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking hearths both inside and outside the huts, which suggests that, depending on the weather, people could cook food either indoors or outdoors. \nStone tools have been found from many sites as well. Many of these are different from the earlier Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles used for grinding grain and other plant produce. Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain even today, several thousand years later. At the same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued to be made and used, and remember, some tools were also made of bone. \nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been found. These were sometimes decorated, and were used for storing things. People began using pots for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat and lentils that now became an important part of the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using different kinds of materials, for example cotton, that could now be grown. \nDid things change everywhere and all at once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women still continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere people adopted farming and herding slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, in some cases people tried to combine these activities, doing different things during different seasons.imals \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what types of valuable materials did Egyptian kings and Harappan rulers send people to distant lands to acquire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMost of Egypt is a dry desert, except for the lands along the river Nile \nAround 5000 years ago, kings ruled over Egypt.

Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally, fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river. In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors contributed to the transformation of the struggle against British rule into a mass movement after 1919, and how did various social groups interpret and participate in the Non-Cooperation Movement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question asks about the factors contributing to the growth of mass nationalism after 1919. The text states, 'After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement... Why was this so?' It then lists several reasons: The First World War altered the economic and political situation in India, leading to a huge rise in defence expenditure, increased taxes on incomes and business profits, and a sharp rise in prices. Conversely, business groups reaped profits, and Indian industries expanded, leading them to demand greater opportunities. The war also led the British to expand their army, pressuring villages to supply soldiers, many of whom returned with anti-colonial views. Furthermore, the 1917 Russian Revolution, with its news of peasant and worker struggles and socialist ideas, inspired Indian nationalists. Finally, the advent of Mahatma Gandhi, who arrived in 1915 from South Africa as an already respected leader, and his subsequent travels and interventions in local movements, played a crucial role in his emergence as a mass leader.\n\nThe second part of the question asks how various social groups interpreted and participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement. The text describes the movement's momentum through 1921-22, noting that thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges, many lawyers gave up their practices, British titles were surrendered, legislatures boycotted, and people lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. Beyond these general actions, specific interpretations and participations are mentioned:\n*   In Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organized non-violent campaigns against high land revenue demands.\n*   In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed.\n*   In Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged 'forest satyagrahas,' protesting restricted forest resource use by sending cattle into forests without paying grazing fees. They believed Gandhiji would reduce their taxes and abolish forest regulations, proclaiming 'swaraj' and 'Gandhi Raj.'\n*   In Sind and Bengal, Muslim traders and peasants were enthusiastic about the Khilafat call, and the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance fostered communal unity and strength.\n*   In Punjab, the Akali agitation, seeking to remove corrupt mahants from gurdwaras, closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement.\n*   In Assam, tea garden labourers demanded wage increases, left plantations shouting 'Gandhi Maharaj ki Jai,' believing they were following Gandhiji's wish, and even substituted 'Krishna' with 'Gandhi Raja' in local Vaishnava songs.\n*   In Pratapgarh, United Provinces, peasants managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants, crediting Gandhiji with this achievement, even though their actions sometimes did not conform to Gandhian ideals.\n\nAnswer: The struggle against British rule transformed into a mass movement after 1919 due to several factors: the economic and political changes brought about by the First World War, including increased taxes and prices, expansion of Indian industries, and soldiers returning with anti-colonial sentiments; the inspiration from the 1917 Russian Revolution's ideas of peasant and worker struggles; and the emergence of Mahatma Gandhi as a mass leader following his return from South Africa in 1915. During the Non-Cooperation Movement, various social groups participated and interpreted Gandhi's call in their own ways. This included students leaving government institutions, lawyers giving up practices, and boycotts of British titles, legislatures, and foreign cloth. More specifically:\n*   Patidar peasants in Kheda organized non-violent campaigns against high land revenue.\n*   Liquor shops were picketed in coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu.\n*   Tribals and poor peasants in Guntur staged 'forest satyagrahas' against restricted forest resources, believing 'Gandhi Raj' would bring tax reductions and abolished regulations.\n*   Muslim traders and peasants in Sind and Bengal enthusiastically supported the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance, strengthening communal unity.\n*   The Akali agitation in Punjab, aimed at removing corrupt mahants, identified with the movement.\n*   Tea garden labourers in Assam demanded wage increases and left plantations, shouting 'Gandhi Maharaj ki Jai' and associating 'Gandhi Raja' with their aspirations.\n*   Peasants in Pratapgarh stopped illegal evictions, crediting Gandhiji with their success."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.10", "8.9.2", "6.4.11", "6.2.1", "6.4.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAround the time when Jainism and Buddhism were becoming popular, brahmins developed the system of ashramas. Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study \n Much before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at a place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country. \nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of Odisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and 1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no inclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Odisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817. \nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures. It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of shortterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case of natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal. \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these grievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of making salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape. \nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took away a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions with Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started. The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The priests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support. \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha. Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi jagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed, many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by May 1817 the uprising was mostly contained. \nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May 1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and forbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary reforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \n In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had far reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To merely call it a \u2018Paik Rebellion\u2019 will thus be an understatement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWhile many people lived in the cities, others living in the countryside grew crops and reared animals. These farmers and herders supplied food to crafts persons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We know from remains of plants that the Harappans grew wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed and mustard. \nA new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds. While real ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have not survived, toy models have been found. As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used. This means that water was stored and supplied to the fields when the plants were growing. \nThe Harappans reared cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available around settlements. However, in the dry summer months large herds of animals were probably taken to greater distances in search of grass and water. They also collected fruits like ber, caught fish and hunted wild animals like the antelope. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did agricultural practices and related technologies differ between the Harappan civilization and the period between 700 and 1750 CE, based on the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text describes Harappan agricultural practices, stating they grew crops like wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed, and mustard. They used a 'plough' for digging and planting, and 'some form of irrigation' was likely used to store and supply water due to low rainfall. The second text, covering the period between 700 and 1750 CE, mentions a 'gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture'. It highlights the appearance of 'new technologies' such as the 'Persian wheel in irrigation' and the arrival of 'new foods and beverages' like potatoes, corn, and chillies. Therefore, a key difference in technology is the specific mention of the Persian wheel for irrigation in the later period, compared to a more general 'some form of irrigation' and the plough in the Harappan era. Additionally, the range of crops expanded significantly in the later period with the introduction of new food items.\n\nAnswer: During the Harappan civilization, farmers grew crops such as wheat, barley, and pulses, utilizing a plough and likely some form of irrigation. In contrast, the period between 700 and 1750 CE saw an extension of agriculture through forest clearing, the introduction of advanced technologies like the Persian wheel for irrigation, and the arrival of new crops and foods such as potatoes, corn, and chillies."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.7", "7.1.4", "8.5.6", "6.7.9"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the key features of the Permanent Settlement, Mahalwari Settlement, and Ryotwari (Munro) system, and highlight the main problems encountered with each by the East India Company."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes three distinct revenue systems implemented by the East India Company. \n\n1.  **Permanent Settlement (1793):**\n    *   **Features:** Introduced in 1793, it recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars. They were tasked with collecting rent from peasants and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. The aim was to ensure a regular revenue flow and encourage zamindars to invest in land improvement.\n    *   **Problems:** Company officials found zamindars were not investing in land improvement. The fixed revenue was initially too high, leading many zamindaris to be sold off. Later, as market prices rose and cultivation expanded, zamindars' income increased, but the Company gained nothing due to the fixed revenue. Cultivators found the system oppressive with high rents, insecure land rights, and frequent evictions.\n\n2.  **Mahalwari Settlement (1822):**\n    *   **Features:** Devised by Holt Mackenzie in 1822 for the North Western Provinces. It focused on the 'mahal' (village or group of villages) as the revenue unit. Collectors inspected land, measured fields, and recorded customs, with the estimated revenue of each plot added up for the entire mahal. This demand was to be revised periodically, not fixed permanently. The village headman, rather than the zamindar, was responsible for collecting and paying the revenue.\n    *   **Problems:** The text does not explicitly detail unique problems for the Mahalwari system alone but notes a general problem with 'new systems' (which would include Mahalwari and Ryotwari) where revenue officials fixed too high a demand, leading to peasants being unable to pay, ryots fleeing, and villages becoming deserted.\n\n3.  **Ryotwari (Munro) System:**\n    *   **Features:** Developed by Thomas Munro (and initially tried by Captain Alexander Read) in the southern British territories, where there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement was made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields were carefully and separately surveyed before revenue assessment.\n    *   **Problems:** Similar to the general issues with the new systems, revenue officials fixed excessively high demands to increase income. This resulted in peasants being unable to pay, ryots deserting the countryside, and villages becoming deserted in many regions.\n\nAnswer: The Permanent Settlement (1793) recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars, fixing revenue permanently, but led to zamindars not investing in land and cultivators facing high rents and evictions. The Mahalwari Settlement (1822) in the North Western Provinces made the village (mahal) the unit, with periodically revised revenue collected by the village headman. The Ryotwari (Munro) system, prevalent in the south, settled directly with cultivators (ryots) after surveying their fields. A common problem across the Mahalwari and Ryotwari systems was that revenue officials fixed excessively high demands, causing peasants to flee and villages to become deserted."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwara. \nBefore his death in 1539, Baba Guru Nanak appointed one of his followers as his successor. His name was Lehna but he came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that he was a part of Baba Guru Nanak himself. Guru Angad compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur\u2019s son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as \u2018a state within the state\u2019. The Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement. The ideas of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this development from the very beginning. He emphasised the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications. This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons. The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, how did the Delhi Sultanate consolidate its control and expand its territory, and what factors contributed to the early Sikh community's rise as a distinct, self-governing entity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for two distinct parts: the Delhi Sultanate's consolidation and expansion, and the factors for the Sikh community's rise as a self-governing entity. I will extract information for each part directly from the respective text sections.\n\n**For the Delhi Sultanate's consolidation and expansion:**\n1.  **Initial State:** The text states that in the early thirteenth century, control was limited to heavily fortified towns, and the Sultans depended on trade, tribute, or plunder for supplies, with distant control being difficult due to communication issues, rebellion, and Mongol invasions (Section 1, paragraph 1).\n2.  **Consolidation:** This occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban (Section 1, paragraph 1).\n3.  **Expansion:** Further expansion happened under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq (Section 1, paragraph 1).\n4.  **'Internal Frontier' Campaigns:** These aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of garrison towns. Methods included clearing forests in the Ganga-Yamuna doab, expelling hunter-gatherers and pastoralists, encouraging agriculture by giving land to peasants, and establishing new fortresses, garrison towns, and towns to protect trade routes and promote regional trade (Section 1, paragraph 2).\n5.  **'External Frontier' Expansion:** This involved military expeditions into southern India, starting with Alauddin Khalji and culminating with Muhammad Tughluq. These campaigns resulted in the capture of elephants, horses, slaves, and precious metals (Section 1, paragraph 3).\n6.  **Administrative Measures:** By Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, the Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice (Section 1, paragraph 4).\n7.  **Symbolic Presence:** The Delhi Sultans built mosques across the subcontinent to demonstrate their claims as protectors of Islam and Muslims, and to foster a sense of community among diverse believers (Section 1, paragraph 5).\n\n**For the early Sikh community's rise as a distinct, self-governing entity:**\n1.  **Foundational Practices:** Baba Guru Nanak established a center at Kartarpur where followers, irrespective of creed, caste, or gender, ate together in a common kitchen (langar) and engaged in regular worship of his hymns, creating a sacred space known as dharmsal (now Gurdwara) (Section 2, paragraph 1).\n2.  **Spiritual Unification:** The compilation of Baba Guru Nanak's compositions by Guru Angad (who added his own in Gurmukhi) and subsequent Gurus, culminating in Guru Arjan's compilation in 1604 (which became the Guru Granth Sahib, authenticated by Guru Gobind Singh in 1706), provided a unified scripture and doctrinal basis (Section 2, paragraph 2).\n3.  **Emergence of a Center:** By the early seventeenth century, Ramdaspur (Amritsar) developed around Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple) and became virtually self-governing. This led modern historians to describe the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as 'a state within the state' (Section 2, paragraph 3).\n4.  **Mughal Persecution:** Mughal emperor Jahangir viewed them as a threat and ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606, which likely solidified their resolve and distinct identity (Section 2, paragraph 3).\n5.  **Politicisation:** The Sikh movement became politicised in the seventeenth century, culminating in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699, transforming the community (Khalsa Panth) into a political entity (Section 2, paragraph 3).\n6.  **Guru Nanak's Teachings:** His emphasis on the worship of one God, the irrelevance of caste, creed, or gender for liberation, and the pursuit of an active life with a strong sense of social commitment (right worship, welfare of others, purity of conduct; honest living, helping others) fostered a strong sense of equality, community, and social responsibility, which had significant social and political implications (Section 2, paragraph 4).\n\nAnswer: The Delhi Sultanate consolidated its control and expanded its territory through a combination of internal and external campaigns. Internally, they cleared forests, encouraged agriculture in the hinterlands, and established new fortresses and towns to protect trade routes. Externally, they conducted military expeditions into southern India, capturing resources. They also collected taxes, dispensed justice, and built mosques to demonstrate their authority and foster a sense of community.\n\nThe early Sikh community rose as a distinct, self-governing entity due to several factors: the establishment of communal practices like the langar and shared worship by Baba Guru Nanak, the compilation and authentication of their holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) by his successors, the development of a self-governing center at Ramdaspur (Amritsar) around the Harmandar Sahib, persecution by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, and the eventual politicisation of the movement culminating in the institution of the Khalsa. These developments were profoundly influenced by Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s teachings emphasizing the importance of one God, equality across caste, creed, and gender, and an active life with strong social commitment."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.3.3", "7.8.11"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Some of these are preserved in collections of stories such as the Jatakas and the Panchatantra, which were written down around this time. Stories from the Jatakas were often shown on the railings of stupas and in paintings in places such as Ajanta. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare the administrative and military strategies employed by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq to manage their large armies and address the threat of Mongol invasions, highlighting the outcomes of their respective approaches."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text provides a direct comparison of Alauddin Khalji's and Muhammad Tughluq's strategies against Mongol invasions and for maintaining a large army. \n\n1.  **Garrison Town/Housing:** Alauddin Khalji constructed a new garrison town called Siri for his soldiers. In contrast, Muhammad Tughluq emptied the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) of its residents to garrison his soldiers, relocating the residents to Daulatabad.\n\n2.  **Feeding the Army/Taxation:** Both sultans fed their armies through taxes collected from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Alauddin Khalji fixed this tax at 50 percent of the peasant's yield. Muhammad Tughluq, however, levied *additional* taxes for maintaining his large army, which coincided with a famine in the area.\n\n3.  **Paying Soldiers:** Both paid their soldiers cash salaries.\n\n4.  **Controlling Prices/Currency:** Alauddin Khalji controlled the prices of goods in Delhi to prevent inflation, with officers surveying prices and punishing non-compliant merchants.

Muhammad Tughluq's strategies were largely a failure, leading to widespread resentment, rebellion, and the recall of the token currency."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.1", "6.12.8", "7.3.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The potter used to expose the earthenware to very high temperature in his kiln which resulted in the blackening of its outer surface. A fine black slip was also applied on this, which gave the pottery a mirror-like shine \nFind Arikamedu (in Puducherry) on Map 7 (page 113), and read the box on Rome on page 96. Between 2200 and 1900 years ago, Arikamedu was a coastal settlement where ships unloaded goods from distant lands. A massive brick structure, which may have been a warehouse, was found at the site. Other finds include pottery from the Mediterranean region, such as amphorae (tall double-handled jars that contained liquids such as wine or oil) and stamped red-glazed pottery, known as Arretine Ware, which was named after a city in Italy. This was made by pressing wet clay into a stamped mould. There was yet another kind of pottery which was made locally, though Roman designs were used. Roman lamps, glassware and gems have also been found at the site. \nSmall tanks have been found that were probably dyeing vats, used to dye cloth. There is plenty of evidence for the making of beads from semi-precious stones and glass. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nArchaeologists have found traces of huts or houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, which were dug into the ground, with steps leading into them. These may have provided shelter in cold weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking hearths both inside and outside the huts, which suggests that, depending on the weather, people could cook food either indoors or outdoors. \nStone tools have been found from many sites as well. Many of these are different from the earlier Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles used for grinding grain and other plant produce. Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain even today, several thousand years later. At the same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued to be made and used, and remember, some tools were also made of bone. \nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been found. These were sometimes decorated, and were used for storing things. People began using pots for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat and lentils that now became an important part of the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using different kinds of materials, for example cotton, that could now be grown. \nDid things change everywhere and all at once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women still continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere people adopted farming and herding slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, in some cases people tried to combine these activities, doing different things during different seasons.imals \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere are several ways of finding out about the past. One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men and women (including kings and queens) recorded what they did. For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties? There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone, others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that are made of hard, imperishable substances usually survive for a long time. \nArchaeologists also look for bones \u2014 of animals, birds, and fish \u2014 to find out what people ate in the past. Plant remains survive far more rarely \u2014 if seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt, they survive in a charred form. Do you think cloth is found frequently by archaeologists? \nHistorians, that is, scholars who study the past, often use the word source to refer to the information found from manuscripts, inscriptions and archaeology. Once sources are found, learning about the past becomes an adventure, as we reconstruct it bit by bit. So historians and archaeologists are like detectives, who use all these sources like clues to find out about our pasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What types of pottery are mentioned in the provided texts, and what do their characteristics and uses reveal about the societies that produced or utilized them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need.

These included the significant time commitment required to cultivate plants (days, weeks, months, years), necessitating people to remain in one location to care for them (watering, weeding, driving away animals and birds). Furthermore, these societies faced the practical challenge of storing grain for both food and seed, leading to the development of storage solutions like large clay pots, woven baskets, or dug pits.\n\nThe second section shifts focus to the Maharashtra saint-poets from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries. Their concerns were primarily socio-spiritual. They rejected ritualism, outward displays of piety, and social differences based on birth. They emphasized a personal god, preferred living with families while serving others, and promoted a humanist idea that 'bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain.' The texts also highlight their confrontation with social inequality, particularly the caste system, as evidenced by Chokhamela\u2019s son's abhang questioning why he was made 'low caste.'\n\nTherefore, the distinct types of challenges were practical and survival-oriented for early agricultural societies, whereas for the saint-poets, they were socio-spiritual, focusing on ethical conduct, social justice, and spiritual fulfillment.\n\nAnswer: Early agricultural societies faced practical challenges related to the extensive time and effort required for cultivation and the necessity of developing effective methods for storing grain for food and future seeds. In contrast, the saint-poets of Maharashtra addressed socio-spiritual concerns, rejecting ritualism and social differences based on birth, promoting a humanist idea of sharing others\u2019 pain, and challenging caste inequality."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.4", "7.8.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nCrops for Europe \n\n The British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n10 India After Independence \n\n A New and Divided Nation \n\n When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges. As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nBABUR 1526-1530 : 1526 \u2013 defeated Ibrahim Lodi and his Afghan supporters at Panipat. 1527 \u2013 defeated Rana Sanga, Rajput rulers and allies at Khanua. 1528 \u2013 defeated the Rajputs at Chanderi; Established control over Agra and Delhi before his death. \nHUMAYUN 1530-1540, 1555-1556 : (1) Humayun divided his inheritance according to the will of his father. His brothers were each given a province. The ambitions of his brother Mirza Kamran weakened Humayun\u2019s cause against Afghan competitors. Sher Khan defeated Humayun at Chausa (1539) and Kanauj (1540), forcing him to flee to Iran. (2) In Iran Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah. He recaptured Delhi in 1555 but died the next year after an accident in this building. \nAKBAR 1556-1605 : Akbar was 13 years old when he became emperor. His reign can be divided into three periods. (1) 1556-1570 \u2013 Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed. Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan, rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir\u2019s wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful. \nShah Jahan 1627-1658 : Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632 Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan\u2019s sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra. \nAurangzeb 1658-1707 : (1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas. His death was followed by a succession conflict amongst his sons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary difficulties encountered by planters in expanding 'nij' cultivation, and what issues did the 'ryoti' system present for the cultivators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes two main systems of indigo cultivation: 'nij' and 'ryoti'. \n\nFor 'nij' cultivation, the text states several problems: \n1.

Mobilizing labor was also challenging, as it was required during the peasants' busy rice cultivation season. Furthermore, the system demanded a vast number of ploughs and bullocks, posing significant investment and maintenance problems, with supplies often unavailable from peasants. Under the 'ryoti' system, cultivators were forced into contracts, committing them to grow indigo on at least 25% of their land. They received very low prices for their indigo, trapping them in an endless cycle of debt. Planters insisted on using the best soils for indigo, which peasants preferred for rice, and indigo cultivation rapidly exhausted the soil, preventing subsequent rice crops."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.4.3", "6.4.4", "6.12.3", "8.10.1", "8.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident.

A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi).

One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men and women (including kings and queens) recorded what they did. For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties? There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins.

This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce.

As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh.

Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. \nThere are two groups who are described in terms of their work \u2014 the priests, sometimes called brahmins, who performed various rituals, and the rajas. \nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be learning about later. They did not have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Generally, sons did not automatically succeed fathers as rajas. \nTwo words were used to describe the people or the community as a whole. One was the word jana, which we still use in Hindi and other languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 6. \nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name. So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and so on. \nSometimes, the people who composed the hymns described themselves as Aryas and called their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were women and men who were often captured in war. They were treated as the property of their owners, who could make them do whatever work they wanted. \nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of these. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSomewhat before the time of the Mauryan empire, about 2400 years ago, emperors in China began building the Great Wall. \nIt was meant to protect the northern frontier of the empire from pastoral people.

There are watch towers all along, at distances of about 100-200 m. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the primary methods of describing people in the Rigveda, and how did the Rigvedic rajas differ from later rulers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that people in the Rigveda were described in several ways: by the work they do (e.g., priests/brahmins and rajas), by words for the community as a whole (jana and vish), and by identifying themselves as Aryas and their opponents as Dasas or Dasyus based on sacrifices and language.

People said he had miraculous powers \u2013 he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve all their problems. \nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas \u2013 a tribal group that lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region \u2013 Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be in danger. \nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? Who were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter. You have read about tribal societies last year. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThanjavur is also an example of a temple town. Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop. Temples were often central to the economy and society. Rulers built temples to demonstrate their devotion to various deities. They also endowed temples with grants of land and money to carry out elaborate rituals, feed pilgrims and priests and celebrate festivals. Pilgrims who flocked to the temples also made donations. \nBronze is an alloy containing copper and tin. Bell metal contains a greater proportion of tin than other kinds of bronze. This produces a bell-like sound. Chola bronze statues (see Chapter 2) were made using the \u201clost wax\u201d technique. First, an image was made of wax. This was covered with clay and allowed to dry. Next it was heated, and a tiny hole was made in the clay cover. The molten wax was drained out through this hole. Then molten metal was poured into the clay mould through the hole. Once the metal cooled and solidified, the clay cover was carefully removed, and the image was cleaned and polished. \nTemple authorities used their wealth to finance trade and banking. Gradually a large number of priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc. settled near the temple to cater to its needs and those of the pilgrims. Thus grew temple towns. Towns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. \nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships. Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns. Ajmer (Rajasthan) was the capital of the Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later became the suba headquarters under the Mughals. It provides an excellent example of religious coexistence. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, the celebrated Sufi saint (see also Chapter 8) who settled there in the twelfth century, attracted devotees from all creeds. Near Ajmer is a lake, Pushkar, which has attracted pilgrims from ancient times. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were, however, other kinds of societies as well. Many societies in the subcontinent did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. Nor were they divided into numerous unequal classes. Such societies are often called tribes. \nMembers of each tribe were united by kinship bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. Most often they combined these activities to make full use of the natural resources of the area in which they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved from one place to another. A tribal group controlled land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst households according to its own rules. \nMany large tribes thrived in different parts of the subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, deserts and places difficult to reach. Sometimes they clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and preserved their separate culture. \nBut the caste-based and tribal societies also depended on each other for their diverse needs. This relationship, of conflict and dependence, gradually caused both societies to change. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the defining characteristics of tribal societies in the subcontinent, including their social structure, livelihoods, and their interaction with caste-based societies, according to the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for the defining characteristics of tribal societies based on the provided text.

Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What significant changes did British colonial rule impose on the administrative authority of tribal chiefs, the economic practices of shifting cultivators, and the broader livelihood and trade experiences of tribal groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details several fundamental changes imposed by British colonial rule on tribal lives. \n\n1.  **Tribal Chiefs:** Before British rule, chiefs held significant economic power and administrative rights, including controlling territories, having their own police, and deciding local rules. Under British rule, they 'lost much of their administrative power' and were 'forced to follow laws made by British officials.' They had to 'pay tribute to the British' and 'discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British,' thereby losing their authority among their people.\n\n2.  **Shifting Cultivators:** The British, seeking control and regular revenue, 'wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators' and 'introduced land settlements.' While settled plough cultivation proved difficult and led to suffering for jhum cultivators in dry areas, widespread protests eventually forced the British to 'allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest.'\n\n3.  **Forest Laws and Livelihood:** The British 'extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property.' In 'Reserved Forests,' tribals 'were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals,' forcing many to 'move to other areas in search of work.' To secure labor for timber, the British established 'forest villages' where tribals had to 'provide labour to the Forest Department.'\n\n4.  **Trade Experiences:** Tribal groups faced exploitation as 'traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often.' The example of silk growers shows they were paid 'Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons' while middlemen sold them for 'five times the price,' making 'huge profits.' This led many tribal groups to view 'the market and the traders as their main enemies.'\n\n5.  **Search for Work:** Tribals were recruited 'in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand' through contractors who 'paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home.'\n\nThese points collectively demonstrate a systematic erosion of tribal autonomy, traditional economic practices, access to resources, and increased exploitation.\n\nAnswer: British colonial rule drastically altered tribal lives by stripping tribal chiefs of most of their administrative powers, forcing them to pay tribute and enforce British laws. Shifting cultivators were pressured to settle and adopt plough cultivation through land settlements, although protests led to some concessions for traditional practices. Forest laws declared forests state property, restricting tribal access to resources and forcing many to relocate or provide forced labor in 'forest villages.' Furthermore, tribal groups faced severe economic exploitation from traders and moneylenders, receiving meager payments for their produce, and were recruited for exploitative labor in tea plantations and mines with extremely low wages and restricted movement."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, when railway lines were being laid down for the first time in the Punjab, engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in present-day Pakistan. To them, it seemed like a mound that was a rich source of ready made, high quality bricks. So they carried off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the city to build railway lines. Many buildings were completely destroyed. \nThen, about eighty years ago, archaeologists found the site, and realised that this was one of the oldest cities in the subcontinent. As this was the first city to be discovered, all other sites from where similar buildings (and other things) were found were described as Harappan. These cities developed about 4700 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFallow \u2013 A field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility. Sal \u2013 A tree. Mahua \u2013 A flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol. Bewar \u2013 A term used in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation. \nHow Did Tribal Groups Live? \n\n By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities. Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nCompany Rule Expands \n\n If we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor- General (1798-1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. \nTipu Sultan \u2013 The \u201cTiger of Mysore\u201d The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. \nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1781 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close relationship with the French in India, and modernised his army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious, arrogant and dangerous \u2013 rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1787-89, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \nWar with the Marathas \n From the late eighteenth century the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1781, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy \n It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, carried on the resistance. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book. \nIn the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab was annexed. \nThe Doctrine of Lapse \n The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1858. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1858, the Company also took over Awadh. This time the British had an added argument \u2013 they said they were \u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What methods did the East India Company employ to expand its control over Indian states between 1757 and 1857, and how did British officials perceive different tribal groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question asks about the East India Company's expansion methods. The text from 'Company Rule Expands' section details several strategies: Initially, they used 'political, economic and diplomatic methods'. Specific methods included appointing 'Residents' in Indian states to interfere in internal affairs, forcing 'subsidiary alliances' where rulers paid for Company protection and ceded territory if they failed, and direct military confrontation when interests were threatened, as seen in the wars against Mysore and the Marathas. Later, under Lord Hastings, the policy of 'paramountcy' asserted the Company's supreme authority, justifying annexations. Finally, Lord Dalhousie introduced the 'Doctrine of Lapse', which annexed kingdoms without a male heir, and Awadh was taken over on the grounds of 'misgovernment'. The second part of the question asks about British perception of tribal groups. The 'How Did Tribal Groups Live?' section states that 'British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised.'\n\nAnswer: Between 1757 and 1857, the East India Company expanded its control through a variety of political, economic, and diplomatic methods. These included appointing Residents to interfere in internal state affairs, imposing subsidiary alliances that disarmed Indian rulers and demanded payments for Company forces, and engaging in direct military confrontations (e.g., with Mysore and the Marathas). Later, they introduced policies like 'paramountcy' to assert supreme authority and the 'Doctrine of Lapse' to annex states without a male heir. They also annexed territories like Awadh on the pretext of 'misgovernment'. Regarding tribal groups, British officials considered settled cultivators like the Gonds and Santhals to be more 'civilised' than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators, viewing those living in forests as 'wild and savage' who needed to be settled and civilised."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.1", "8.4.2", "8.2.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe main source of income available to Mughal rulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the economic contributions and practices of the Banjaras, and contrast this with the economic objectives behind the British East India Company's educational policies as outlined in Wood's Despatch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first step is to identify the economic contributions and practices of the Banjaras from the initial text section. The text states that Banjaras were 'the most important tradernomads' whose caravan was called tanda. They transported grain for Sultan Alauddin Khalji to city markets and for Emperor Jahangir and the Mughal army during military campaigns, sometimes with 100,000 bullocks. Peter Mundy described them as carrying 'grains such as wheat and rice' on 14,000 oxen. They bought grain 'where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer,' and then reloaded their oxen with 'anything that can be profitably sold in other places,' indicating their role as merchants who facilitated trade and supply across regions.\n\nThe second step is to identify the economic objectives of the British East India Company's educational policies, specifically from Wood's Despatch, found in the 'British Education in India' section. Wood's Despatch of 1854 emphasized 'the practical benefits of a system of European learning.' Its economic uses were to enable Indians 'to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country.' Furthermore, it aimed to change Indians' 'tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe.'\n\nFinally, to contrast these, the Banjaras' practices involved direct participation in trade and transportation, acting as itinerant merchants who moved goods based on existing supply and demand to meet the needs of cities and armies. Their activities were about facilitating the movement and exchange of commodities within the existing economic structure. In contrast, the British East India Company's objectives, through Wood's Despatch, were not merely to facilitate existing trade but to fundamentally alter Indian education to instill European learning, specifically to expand British trade and commerce, develop resources for British benefit, and crucially, to manipulate Indian consumer tastes to create a market and demand for British manufactured goods.\n\nAnswer: The Banjaras were crucial trader-nomads who significantly contributed to the economy by transporting goods, primarily grain, over long distances. They supplied city markets for rulers like Alauddin Khalji and provisioned the Mughal army, carrying vast quantities of wheat and rice on their oxen. They operated as merchants, buying goods where they were cheap and selling them where prices were higher, effectively facilitating inter-regional trade and supply.\n\nIn contrast, the British East India Company's economic objectives, as articulated in Wood's Despatch of 1854, were to leverage European learning to expand trade and commerce and develop India's resources. A key aim was to influence Indian tastes and desires through education, thereby creating a demand for British manufactured goods and encouraging Indians to purchase items produced in Europe. While the Banjaras directly engaged in and facilitated existing trade, the British policy sought to reshape the economy and consumer culture to primarily benefit British industrial and commercial interests."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.4", "8.7.1", "7.4.7", "8.9.2", "7.4.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nConclusion \n\n Thus the East India Company was transformed from a trading company to a territorial colonial power. The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \nBy 1857 the Company came to exercise direct rule over about 83 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, how did new technologies influence both the East India Company's expansion and the societal developments in the Indian subcontinent between 700 and 1750?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that 'The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process' of the East India Company transforming into a colonial power. It further details that 'Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India.' For the period between 700 and 1750, the second text section mentions that 'new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat.' It also clarifies that these 'innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well.

The chain of thought thus connects specific technologies to their respective impacts in the two distinct periods mentioned.\n\nAnswer: New steam technology in the early nineteenth century aided the East India Company's expansion by reducing sea travel time to India from six-eight months to three weeks, which enabled more Britishers and their families to come to the country. In the period between 700 and 1750, new technologies like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat appeared. These innovations, along with new crops, arrived with people bringing new ideas, which resulted in significant economic, political, social, and cultural changes in the subcontinent."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.2.5", "7.1.4", "7.7.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop. Temples were often central to the economy and society. Rulers built temples to demonstrate their devotion to various deities. They also endowed temples with grants of land and money to carry out elaborate rituals, feed pilgrims and priests and celebrate festivals. Pilgrims who flocked to the temples also made donations. \nBronze is an alloy containing copper and tin. Bell metal contains a greater proportion of tin than other kinds of bronze. This produces a bell-like sound. Chola bronze statues (see Chapter 2) were made using the \u201clost wax\u201d technique. First, an image was made of wax. This was covered with clay and allowed to dry. Next it was heated, and a tiny hole was made in the clay cover. The molten wax was drained out through this hole. Then molten metal was poured into the clay mould through the hole. Once the metal cooled and solidified, the clay cover was carefully removed, and the image was cleaned and polished. \nTemple authorities used their wealth to finance trade and banking. Gradually a large number of priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc. settled near the temple to cater to its needs and those of the pilgrims. Thus grew temple towns. Towns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. \nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships. Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns. Ajmer (Rajasthan) was the capital of the Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later became the suba headquarters under the Mughals. It provides an excellent example of religious coexistence. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, the celebrated Sufi saint (see also Chapter 8) who settled there in the twelfth century, attracted devotees from all creeds. Near Ajmer is a lake, Pushkar, which has attracted pilgrims from ancient times. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently. The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMehrunnisa married the Emperor Jahangir in 1611 and received the title Nur Jahan. She remained extremely loyal and supportive to the monarch. As a mark of honour, Jahangir struck silver coins bearing his own titles on one side and on the other the inscription \u201cstruck in the name of the Queen Begum, Nur Jahan\u201d. The adjoining document is an order (farman) of Nur Jahan. The square seal states, \u201cCommand of her most Sublime and Elevated Majesty Nur Jahan Padshah Begum\u201d. The round seal states, \u201cby the sun of Shah Jahangir she became as brilliant as the moon; may Nur Jahan Padshah be the lady of the age\u201d. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHow did the Cholas rise to power? A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did the Mauryan and Chola empires approach local governance and the collection of resources, highlighting any differences in their administrative structures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought will first detail the Mauryan administrative approach to local governance and resource collection, then describe the Chola methods, and finally, synthesize these points to highlight the differences. \n\n1.  **Mauryan Empire's Approach**: The text states that the Mauryan empire's administration varied by region. \n    *   **Local Governance**: The area around Pataliputra was under 'direct control of the emperor,' where officials were appointed to collect taxes and punish disobedience. In 'other areas or provinces' like Taxila or Ujjain, rule was from a provincial capital with royal princes as governors, but 'local customs and rules were probably followed,' indicating a degree of local autonomy. 'Vast areas between these centres' had Mauryan control over 'roads and rivers' for transport. 'Forested regions' were 'more or less independent,' though expected to provide certain resources. \n    *   **Resource Collection**: Officials in the directly controlled area collected 'taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders.' In the vast areas between centers, resources were collected as 'tax and tribute,' citing examples like 'blankets' from the north-west and 'gold and precious stones' from south India. Forested regions were expected to provide 'elephants, timber, honey and wax.'\n\n2.  **Chola Empire's Approach**: The text details a more structured local administration for the Chola empire.\n    *   **Local Governance**: Settlements of peasants, 'ur,' formed larger units called 'nadu.' Both the 'village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice.' 'Rich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu' under central supervision. Brahmana landholders formed 'assemblies or sabha' in 'brahmadeya' settlements, which 'worked very efficiently' and had 'separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc.' Membership to the sabha had strict criteria including land ownership, age, knowledge of Vedas, and administrative experience, as detailed in the Uttaramerur inscription.\n    *   **Resource Collection**: The 'nadu' was responsible for 'collecting taxes.' The text mentions 'land revenue' being collected from land owned by sabha members. Temples were 'endowed with land by rulers as well as by others,' and the 'produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple.' Various 'categories of land' like 'vellanvagai' (non-Brahmana peasant proprietors), 'brahmadeya' (gifted to Brahmanas), and 'devadana' (gifted to temples) are also mentioned, implying different revenue or usage structures.\n\n3.  **Differences in Administrative Structures**: \n    *   **Directness of Control**: The Mauryan administration showed a gradient of control, from direct rule near the capital to significant local autonomy or indirect control in outlying and forested regions. The Cholas, while having a central government, delegated significant administrative functions (justice, tax collection) to highly organized local bodies like the 'nadu' and 'sabha,' which had specific rules and involved local elites (Vellala peasants, Brahmana landholders).\n    *   **Formalization of Local Bodies**: Chola administration featured formalized local self-governance structures (ur, nadu, sabha) with detailed eligibility criteria for members, suggesting a more institutionalized local administrative framework than the Mauryan system which relied more on appointed officials in directly controlled areas and local customs/princes in provinces.\n    *   **Resource Collection Mechanisms**: Mauryans collected taxes from diverse groups and tributes of specific resources based on regional availability. Cholas relied heavily on land revenue collected by local bodies and also utilized land endowments to temples as a means of supporting specialists and services, integrating religious institutions into the economic and administrative framework.\n\nAnswer: The Mauryan Empire employed a varied administrative approach, with direct control and tax collection by appointed officials in areas around Pataliputra, while provinces like Taxila and Ujjain were ruled from capitals by governors, often royal princes, who likely followed local customs. Vast intermediate areas focused on controlling transport routes and collecting resources as tax and tribute, and forested regions were largely independent, providing specific resources like elephants and timber. In contrast, the Chola Empire featured a more formalized local governance structure, with peasant settlements ('ur') forming larger units ('nadu') responsible for justice and tax collection. Rich peasants of the Vellala caste held considerable influence in the 'nadu,' and Brahmana landholders managed 'brahmadeya' settlements through highly efficient assemblies ('sabha') with detailed membership criteria. Resource collection in the Chola empire primarily involved taxes collected by the 'nadu' and land revenue, with temples also playing a significant economic role through land endowments that supported specialists."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.3", "7.2.5", "7.4.9", "7.6.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAnimals multiply naturally. Besides, if they are looked after carefully, they provide milk, which is an important source of food, and meat, whenever required. In other words, animals that are reared can be used as a \u2018store\u2019 of food \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nTake a look at Table 1 again. You will notice that after the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra until 1526. By then, Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals. This was also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs. \nSome of the states established in this period were small but powerful and extremely well administered. Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun (1530-1540, 1555-1556). Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty. Although the Sur dynasty ruled for only fifteen years (1540-1555), it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made them more efficient. Sher Shah\u2019s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar (1556-1605) when he consolidated the Mughal Empire. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFranchise \u2013 The right to vote. \n \nA Constitution is Written \n\n Between December 1946 and November 1949, some three hundred Indians had a series of meetings on the country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key features of the Indian Constitution regarding suffrage, social equality, and language, and who chaired its Drafting Committee?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text details several features of the Indian Constitution. Firstly, regarding suffrage, it adopted 'universal adult franchise,' allowing all Indians above 21 to vote, which was considered a 'revolutionary step' compared to other nations.

Nowadays most girls from middle-class families go to school, and often study with boys. On growing up, many of them go to colleges and universities, and take up jobs after that. They have to be adults before they are legally married, and according to law, they can marry anyone they like, from any caste and community, and widows can remarry too. All women, like all men, can vote and stand for elections. Of course, these rights are not actually enjoyed by all. Poor people have little or no access to education, and in many families, women cannot choose their husbands. \nTwo hundred years ago things were very different. Most children were married off at an early age. Both Hindu and Muslim men could marry more than one wife. In some parts of the country, widows were praised if they chose death by burning themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands. Women who died in this manner, whether willingly or otherwise, were called \u201csati\u201d, meaning virtuous women. Women\u2019s rights to property were also restricted. Besides, most women had virtually no access to education. In many parts of the country people believed that if a woman was educated, she would become a widow. \nDifferences between men and women were not the only ones in society. In most regions, people were divided along lines of caste. Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered themselves as \u201cupper castes\u201d. Others, such as traders and moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were placed after them. Then came peasants, and artisans such as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras). At the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep cities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper castes considered \u201cpolluting\u201d, that is, it could lead to the loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated many of these groups at the bottom as \u201cuntouchable\u201d. They were not allowed to enter temples, draw water from the wells used by the upper castes, or bathe in ponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as inferior human beings. Over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many of these norms and perceptions slowly changed. Let us see how this happened. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the significant differences in the lives and rights of women two hundred years ago compared to women's lives and rights nowadays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text directly contrasts the conditions of women 'nowadays' with 'two hundred years ago'. \n\nFor 'nowadays', the text mentions that most girls from middle-class families go to school, study with boys, go to colleges/universities, take up jobs, marry as adults, can choose their spouse from any caste/community, and widows can remarry. Furthermore, all women can vote and stand for elections.\n\nIn stark contrast, 'two hundred years ago', most children were married off at an early age. Men (both Hindu and Muslim) could have multiple wives. Widows were praised for performing 'sati' (burning themselves on their husband's pyre), and their rights to property were restricted. Most women had virtually no access to education, and it was believed that educated women would become widows.\n\nTherefore, the differences span across education, marriage age and choice, marital practices (polygamy vs. monogamy, widow remarriage), property rights, and political participation.\n\nAnswer: Two hundred years ago, women experienced early marriage, men could marry multiple wives, widows were expected to perform 'sati,' property rights were restricted, and they had virtually no access to education, often due to superstitions. Nowadays, women generally attend school, pursue higher education and jobs, marry as adults by choice, widows can remarry, and they possess voting and electoral rights."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.8.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

These indicate that people, perhaps belonging to the same family, were buried in the same place though not at the same time.

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMost prashastis also mention the ancestors of the ruler. This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full of learned people, including Kalidasa the poet, and Aryabhata the astronomer, about whom you will read more in Chapter 12. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors contributed to the rise of Masulipatnam as a significant port in the 17th century and its eventual decline by the 18th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text provides several reasons for Masulipatnam's importance and subsequent decline. Its rise was due to its location on the delta of the Krishna river, which made it a 'centre of intense activity' and the 'most important port on the Andhra coast' in the seventeenth century. The 'convenience of the road' (a place for ships to anchor) made it a residence for merchants once the Dutch and English nations frequented the coast. Fierce competition among various trading groups\u2014including Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders\u2014further made the city 'populous and prosperous'. The Dutch also built a fort there.\n\nThe decline of Masulipatnam began when the Mughals extended their power to Golconda, with Emperor Aurangzeb annexing it in 1686-1687. This event caused the European Companies to 'look for alternatives'. The English East India Company adopted a new policy, seeking trade centers that would 'combine political, administrative and commercial roles', rather than just having connections with production centers. As the Company traders subsequently moved to Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, Masulipatnam 'lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century'.\n\nAnswer: Masulipatnam rose to prominence in the 17th century as a key port on the Krishna river delta due to its strategic location, convenience for shipping, intense trading activity by various groups including European companies, and the establishment of a Dutch fort. Its decline in the 18th century was triggered by the Mughal annexation of Golconda, which prompted European companies to seek new trading hubs. The English East India Company, in particular, shifted its focus to centers like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras that offered combined political, administrative, and commercial roles, leading to Masulipatnam's loss of merchants and prosperity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.8", "6.11.4", "7.6.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh.

They drew upon the ideals of love and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages they visited, and set them to music. \nThere were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different caste backgrounds such as potters, \u201cuntouchable\u201d workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and chiefs. The best known among them were Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are two sets of compilations of their songs \u2013 Tevaram and Tiruvacakam. There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally divergent backgrounds, the best known being Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya Prabandham. \nBetween the tenth and twelfth centuries the Chola and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening the links between the bhakti tradition and temple worship. This was also the time when their poems were compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also composed. Today we use these texts as sources for writing histories of the bhakti tradition. \nHagiography : Writing of saints\u2019 lives. \nThis is a composition of Manikkavasagar: Into my vile body of flesh You came, as though it were a temple of gold, And soothed me wholly and saved me, O Lord of Grace, O Gem most Pure, Sorrow and birth and death and illusion You took from me, and set me free. O Bliss! O Light! I have taken refuge in You, And never can I be parted from You. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTraditional food habits are generally based on locally available items of food. Bengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist monasteries) depict scenes of fish being dressed and taken to the market in baskets. \nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat nonvegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for the Bengal Brahmanas. The Brihaddharma Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction. Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the two primary architectural styles employed in monuments, and what significant technological advancements emerged from the twelfth century to facilitate construction?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes two main architectural styles.

He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMost of Egypt is a dry desert, except for the lands along the river Nile \nAround 5000 years ago, kings ruled over Egypt. These kings sent armies to distant lands to get gold, silver, ivory, timber, and precious stones. They also built huge tombs, known as pyramids. \nWhen they died, the bodies of kings were preserved and buried in these pyramids. These carefully preserved bodies are known as \u2018mummies\u2019. A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFrom the sixteenth century, people began to migrate in large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal to the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern Bengal. As they moved eastwards, they cleared forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new communities of peasants. \nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries received land and often set up mosques that served as centres for religious transformation in these areas. \nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. These were provided by community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People referred to them with affection and respect as pirs. \nPir : A Persian word meaning a spiritual guide. \nThis term included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal. \nAnimism : Attribution of living soul to plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena. \nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapters 2 and 5) that temples and other religious structures were often built by individuals or groups who were becoming powerful \u2013 to both demonstrate their power and proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several \u201clow\u201d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). The coming of the European trading companies created new economic opportunities; many families belonging to these social groups availed of these. As their social and economic position improved, they proclaimed their status through the construction of temples. When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts. (Remember the \u201cBangla dome\u201d in Chapter 5?) This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in temple architecture. \nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. Temples were usually built on a square platform. The interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, such decorations reached a high degree of excellence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did British educational policy in India evolve from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, and what were the key viewpoints that shaped these changes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes the evolution of British educational policy in India. Initially, in the late 18th century, the 'tradition of Orientalism' prevailed. Figures like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, and Nathaniel Halhed advocated for promoting Indian learning, including ancient Indian texts, Sanskrit, and Persian, to understand Indian culture and win the respect of the 'natives'. This led to the establishment of the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781 and the Hindu College in Benaras in 1791. However, from the early 19th century, many British officials, such as James Mill, began to criticize Orientalism, arguing that Eastern knowledge was flawed and that education should focus on what was 'useful and practical', primarily Western scientific and technical advances. This criticism intensified by the 1830s with Thomas Babington Macaulay, who strongly advocated for teaching the English language, believing it would 'civilise people' and introduce them to Western literature, science, and philosophy. Macaulay's influence led to the English Education Act of 1835, which made English the medium of instruction for higher education and ceased the promotion of Oriental institutions. The policy further evolved with 'Wood\u2019s Despatch' in 1854, which re-emphasized the practical and economic benefits of European learning, aiming to create demand for British goods and facilitate trade. This Despatch led to the establishment of education departments and universities in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay by 1857. Additionally, Christian missionaries also advocated for moral education through Christian teachings, though the East India Company and later the British government had reservations about directly supporting it.\n\nAnswer: British educational policy in India evolved from an initial Orientalist approach in the late 18th century, which sought to promote Indian learning and ancient texts through institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa (1781) and Hindu College (1791). This was challenged from the early 19th century by critics like James Mill, who advocated for 'useful and practical' Western education. By the 1830s, Thomas Babington Macaulay's strong advocacy for English language instruction, viewing Indian knowledge as inferior, led to the English Education Act of 1835, making English the medium for higher education. Further, the 1854 Wood's Despatch solidified the emphasis on European learning for its practical and economic benefits, leading to the establishment of education departments and universities by 1857. Christian missionaries also pushed for moral education, though their efforts faced initial resistance from the Company and later the government."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.7.1", "6.4.11", "7.5.5", "7.9.8", "7.8.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This fundamentally differed from the Mughal rulers' general strategy, who constantly campaigned against those who refused their authority to extend their influence, even if they often treated defeated opponents honourably to integrate them rather than abandoning conquest altogether."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.6", "7.4.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

We have used the word \u2018pasts\u2019 in plural to draw attention to the fact that the past was different for different groups of people. For example, the lives of herders or farmers were different from those of kings and queens, the lives of merchants were different from those of crafts persons, and so on. Also, as is true even today, people followed different practices and customs in different parts  of the country. For example, today most people living in the Andaman Islands get their own food by fishing, hunting, and collecting forest produce. By contrast, most people living in cities depend on others for supplies of food. Differences such as these existed in the past as well. \nBesides, there is another kind of difference. We know a great deal about kings and the battles they fought because they kept records of their victories. Generally, ordinary people such as hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers or herders did not keep records of what they did. While archaeology helps us to find out about their lives, there is much that remains unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nCrops for Europe \n\n The British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nStone tools were probably made using two different techniques: 1. The first is called stone on stone. Here, the pebble from which the tool was to be made (also called the core) was held in one hand. Another stone, which was used as a hammer was held in the other hand. The second stone was used to strike off flakes from the first, till the required shape was obtained. 2. Pressure flaking: Here the core was placed on a firm surface. The hammer stone was used on a piece of bone or stone that was placed on the core, to remove flakes that could be shaped into tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nTemples and mosques were beautifully constructed because they were places of worship. They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the multiple functions of temples and mosques for rulers, and how did both Hindu kings and Muslim Sultans associate themselves with divine power through these constructions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the first section explicitly states that temples and mosques were built not only as places of worship but also to 'demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron.' It further mentions that constructing places of worship gave rulers the opportunity to 'proclaim their close relationship with God.' For Hindu kings, the example of King Rajarajadeva is given, where he took his god's name, Rajarajeshvaram, because it was 'auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god.' The text highlights that 'through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram),' and that the temple represented a 'miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies,' where their worship seemed to bring 'the just rule of the gods on earth.'

An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he possessed qualities like 'Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past.'\n\nAnswer: Beyond being places of worship, temples and mosques served to demonstrate the power, wealth, and devotion of the patron, and allowed rulers to proclaim their close relationship with God. Hindu kings, like Rajarajadeva, associated themselves with divinity by adopting names similar to their gods to appear god-like and through rituals where the king, seen as a god, honored another deity. The temple was also a miniature model of the king's world, symbolizing divine endorsement of his rule. Muslim Sultans and Padshahs, while not claiming to be incarnations of God, were described as the 'Shadow of God,' with figures like Alauddin being chosen by God for their qualities as great lawgivers."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.5.3", "6.1.5", "6.2.4", "8.3.2", "6.7.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nZoroaster was an Iranian prophet. His teachings are contained in a book called the Avesta. The language of the Avesta, and the practices described in it are very similar to those of the Vedas. The basic teachings of Zoroaster are contained in the maxim \u201cGood thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.\u201d Here is a verse from the Zend Avesta: \u201cLord, grant strength and the rule of truth and good thinking, by means of which one shall create peace and tranquillity.\u201d \nFor more than a thousand years, Zoroastrianism was a major religion in Iran. Later, some Zoroastrians migrated from Iran and settled down in the coastal towns of Gujarat and Maharashtra. They were the ancestors of today\u2019s Parsis. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the core principles of Ashoka's dhamma and what specific actions did he take to propagate it and resolve societal challenges within his empire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the first section explains Ashoka's dhamma.

The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Delhi Sultans overcome their early limitations and expand their authority across the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that in the early thirteenth century, the Delhi Sultans' control was limited to heavily fortified garrison towns, and they were dependent on external sources for supplies, as they seldom controlled the hinterland.

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe city of Dholavira was located on Khadir Beyt (also spelled as Bet) in the Rann of Kutch, where there was fresh water and fertile soil. Unlike some of the other Harappan cities, which were divided into two parts, Dholavira was divided into three parts, and each part was surrounded with massive stone walls, with entrances through gateways. There was also a large open area in the settlement, where public ceremonies could be held. Other finds include large letters of the Harappan script that were carved out of white stone and perhaps inlaid in wood. This is a unique find as generally Harappan writing has been found on small objects such as seals. \nThe city of Lothal stood beside a tributary of the Sabarmati, in Gujarat, close to the Gulf of Khambat. It was situated near areas where raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available. This was an important centre for making objects out of stone, shell and metal. There was also a store house in the city. Many seals and sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were found in this storehouse. \nA building that was found here was probably a workshop for making beads: pieces of stone, half made beads, tools for bead making, and finished beads have all been found here. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What unique artifact was discovered in Dholavira, and what severe economic consequence did Bengal face due to the East India Company's initial revenue policies before the Permanent Settlement was introduced?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question asks about a unique artifact in Dholavira.

Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAround 3500 years ago, we find some of the first evidence of writing in China. \nThese writings were on animal bones. These are called oracle bones, because they were used to predict the future. Kings got scribes to write questions on the bones \u2014 would they win battles? Would the harvest be good? Would they have sons? The bones were then put into the fire, and they cracked because of the heat. Then fortunetellers studied these cracks, and tried to predict the future. As you may expect, they sometimes made mistakes. \nThese kings lived in palaces in cities. They amassed vast quantities of wealth, including large, elaborately decorated bronze vessels.

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done?

The text first introduces the East India Company becoming the Diwan of Bengal in 1765, necessitating the organization of revenue resources. Initially, the Company aimed to increase revenue without a regular system, leading to an economic crisis and famine in Bengal.\n2. To address the need for reliable revenue, the Company introduced the 'Permanent Settlement' in 1793. Under this system, rajas and taluqdars were recognized as zamindars, responsible for collecting rent from peasants and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. This was intended to ensure a regular flow of revenue and encourage zamindars to invest in land improvement.\n3. The problems with the Permanent Settlement are detailed: Company officials found that zamindars were not investing in land improvement, as the fixed revenue was initially too high, leading to many zamindaris being sold off when payments failed. Later, as market prices rose and cultivation expanded, the zamindars' income increased, but the Company gained nothing due to the permanently fixed revenue. Furthermore, cultivators found the system oppressive, facing high rents, insecure land rights, and often eviction.\n4. Due to these issues and the Company's need for more revenue, new systems were devised. In the North Western Provinces, Holt Mackenzie introduced the 'mahalwari settlement' in 1822. This system involved calculating the revenue for each village (mahal) based on field surveys and customs, with the demand revised periodically, and the village headman responsible for collection.\n5. In the British territories in the south, the 'Munro system' or 'ryotwari' was developed by Captain Alexander Read and Thomas Munro. This system involved direct settlement with the cultivators (ryots) after careful and separate surveys of their fields, with the British intending to act as paternal protectors.\n6. The text notes that even with these new systems, high revenue demands often led to peasants being unable to pay, ryots fleeing, and villages becoming deserted.\n7. The second text section discusses ancient Rome and its infrastructure, which is not relevant to the East India Company's revenue systems in India.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company implemented several revenue settlement systems in India. The first major system was the Permanent Settlement, introduced in 1793, which recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars responsible for collecting rent and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. Later, the mahalwari settlement was devised in the North Western Provinces in 1822, which calculated revenue for each village (mahal) with periodically revised demands collected by the village headman. In the south, the ryotwari (or Munro) system was introduced, making settlements directly with cultivators (ryots) after surveying their fields.\n\nThe Permanent Settlement created several problems: zamindars often failed to invest in land improvement because the fixed revenue was too high, leading to the sale of many zamindaris.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the methods by which the muvendar accumulated wealth and power in ancient South India, and identify the key grievances that fueled the predicted 'massive upheaval' against British rule."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer the first part of the question, I will refer to the first text section. The text states that 'Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful,' specifically mentioning the muvendar (Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas). Their methods of accumulating wealth and power included demanding and receiving gifts from the people instead of regular taxes, and going on military expeditions to collect tribute from neighboring areas. They would keep some of this wealth and distribute the rest among their supporters, including family, soldiers, and poets, who were often rewarded with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth.\n\nFor the second part of the question, I will refer to the second text section, which discusses the 'massive upheaval' during British rule. According to Vishnubhatt Godse's account, a primary grievance was the belief that the English were 'determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims' through a list of eighty-four rules that kings refused to accept, leading to plans for a 'war of religion.' Sitaram Pande's memoirs add that the 'seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust.' Additionally, agents incited sepoys by highlighting British treachery and promising the restoration of the Emperor of Delhi. A significant grievance was the report that new rifle cartridges were 'greased with the fat of cows and pigs,' which would defile both Mahommedans and Hindus, leading to the belief that the English aimed to convert them to Christians.\n\nAnswer: In ancient South India, the muvendar (Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas) accumulated wealth and power by controlling fertile river valleys like the Kaveri and coastal areas. They did not collect regular taxes but instead demanded and received gifts from the people. They also conducted military expeditions to collect tribute from neighboring regions, distributing a portion of this wealth among their supporters, including family, soldiers, and poets.\n\nDuring British rule, key grievances fueling the predicted 'massive upheaval' included the widespread belief among sepoys that the English intended to eradicate Hindu and Muslim religions, as evidenced by the introduction of 'eighty-four rules' that kings rejected. The 'seizing of Oudh' also generated significant distrust. Furthermore, the introduction of new rifle cartridges rumored to be greased with the fat of cows and pigs was perceived as a deliberate attempt to defile the religions of both Hindus and Muslims and convert them to Christianity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.2", "8.5.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Given below are the important changes that were introduced by the British. \n1. The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of Indian affairs. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a council to advise him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. Through these measures the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India. \n2. All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as subordinates of the British Crown. \n3. It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4. The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British believed that they were responsible for the rebellion in a big way. \n 5. The British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India. \n 6. Policies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and give them security of rights over their lands. \n Thus a new phase of history began after 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nOstriches were found in India during the Palaeolithic period.

A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe sword of Tipu Sultan and Wootz steel \n\n We begin the story of Indian steel and iron metallurgy by recounting the famous story of Tipu Sultan who ruled Mysore till 1799, fought four wars with the British and died fighting with his sword in his hand. Tipu\u2019s legendary swords are now part of valuable collections in museums in England. But do you know why the sword was so special? The sword had an incredibly hard and sharp edge that could easily rip through the opponent\u2019s armour. This quality of the sword came from a special type of high carbon steel called Wootz which was produced all over south India. Wootz steel when made into swords produced a very sharp edge with a flowing water pattern. This pattern came from very small carbon crystals embedded in the iron. \nFrancis Buchanan who toured through Mysore in 1800, a year after Tipu Sultan\u2019s death, has left us an account of the technique by which Wootz steel was produced in many hundreds of smelting furnaces in Mysore. In these furnaces, iron was mixed with charcoal and put inside small clay pots. Through an intricate control of temperatures the smelters produced steel ingots that were used for sword making not just in India but in West and Central Asia too. Wootz is an anglicised version of the Kannada word ukku, Telugu hukku and Tamil and Malayalam urukku \u2013 meaning steel. \nIndian Wootz steel fascinated European scientists. Michael Faraday, the legendary scientist and discoverer of electricity and electromagnetism, spent four years studying the properties of Indian Wootz (1818-22). However, the Wootz steel making process, which was so widely known in south India, was completely lost by the mid-nineteenth century. Can you guess why this was so? The swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India. \nAbandoned furnaces in villages \n Production of Wootz steel required a highly specialised technique of refining iron. But iron smelting in India was extremely common till the end of the nineteenth century. In Bihar and Central India, in particular, every district had smelters that used local deposits of ore to produce iron which was widely used for the manufacture of implements and tools of daily use. The furnaces were most often built of clay and sun-dried bricks. The smelting was done by men while women worked the bellows, pumping air that kept the charcoal burning. \nBy the late nineteenth century, however, the craft of iron smelting was in decline. In most villages, furnaces fell into disuse and the amount of iron produced came down. Why was this so? One reason was the new forest laws that you have read about (Chapter 4). When the colonial government prevented people from entering the reserved forests, how could the iron smelters find wood for charcoal? Where could they get iron ore? Defying forest laws, they often entered the forests secretly and collected wood, but they could not sustain their occupation on this basis for long. Many gave up their craft and looked for other means of livelihood. \nIn some areas the government did grant access to the forest. But the iron smelters had to pay a very high tax to the forest department for every furnace they used. This reduced their income. Moreover, by the late nineteenth century iron and steel was being imported from Britain. Ironsmiths in India began using the imported iron to manufacture utensils and implements. This inevitably lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters. By the early twentieth century, the artisans producing iron and steel faced a new competition. \nIron and steel factories come up in India \n The year was 1904. In the hot month of April, Charles Weld, an American geologist and Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of Jamsetji Tata, were travelling in Chhattisgarh in search of iron ore deposits. They had spent many months on a costly venture looking for sources of good iron ore to set up a modern iron and steel plant in India. Jamsetji Tata had decided to spend a large part of his fortune to build a big iron and steel industry in India. But this could not be done without identifying the source of fine quality iron ore. \nOne day, after travelling for many hours in the forests, Weld and Dorabji came upon a small village and found a group of men and women carrying basketloads of iron ore. These people were the Agarias. When asked where they had found the iron ore, the Agarias pointed to a hill in the distance. Weld and Dorabji reached the hill after an exhausting trek through dense forests. On exploring the hill the geologist declared that they had at last found what they had been looking for. Rajhara Hills had one of the finest ores in the world. \nBut there was a problem. The region was dry and water \u2013 necessary for running the factory \u2013 was not to be found nearby. The Tatas had to continue their search for a more suitable place to set up their factory. However, the Agarias helped in the discovery of a source of iron ore that would later supply the Bhilai Steel Plant. A few years later a large area of forest was cleared on the banks of the river Subarnarekha to set up the factory and an industrial township \u2013 Jamshedpur. Here there was water near iron ore deposits. The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) that came up began producing steel in 1912. \nTISCO was set up at an opportune time. All through the late nineteenth century, India was importing steel that was manufactured in Britain. Expansion of the railways in India had provided a huge market for rails that Britain produced. For a long while, British experts in the Indian Railways were unwilling to believe that good quality steel could be produced in India. \nBy the time TISCO was set up the situation was changing. In 1914 the First World War broke out. Steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe. So imports of British steel into India declined dramatically and the Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails. As the war dragged on for several years, TISCO had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war. By 1919 the colonial government was buying 90 per cent of the steel manufactured by TISCO. Over time TISCO became the biggest steel industry within the British empire. \nIn the case of iron and steel, as in the case of cotton textiles, industrial expansion occurred only when British imports into India declined and the market for Indian industrial goods increased. This happened during the First World War and after. As the nationalist movement developed and the industrial class became stronger, the demand for government protection became louder. Struggling to retain its control over India, the British government had to concede many of these demands in the last decades of colonial rule. \nBellows \u2013 A device or equipment that can pump air. \n Slag heaps \u2013 The waste left when smelting metal. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did British rule transform both the administrative structure of India and its indigenous steel industry after the mid-19th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text details changes in India's administrative structure and the fate of its steel industry under British rule. \n\nFirstly, regarding administrative structure, the text states that after the end of 1859, the British introduced significant changes. The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858, transferring the powers of the East India Company directly to the British Crown, ensuring 'a more responsible management of Indian affairs'. A Secretary of State for India was appointed, advised by the India Council, and the Governor-General was given the title of Viceroy, becoming a 'personal representative of the Crown'. Ruling chiefs were assured that their territories would not be annexed and could pass kingdoms to heirs, but they had to acknowledge the British Queen as 'Sovereign Paramount'. The proportion of Indian soldiers in the army was reduced, European soldiers increased, and recruitment shifted to groups like Gurkhas, Sikhs, and Pathans. Muslims faced large-scale confiscation of land and property and were treated with 'suspicion and hostility'. Policies were also made to protect landlords and zamindars, and the British decided to respect 'customary religious and social practices' (Section 1).\n\nSecondly, concerning the indigenous steel industry, the text explains its decline and later, the rise of a modern steel plant. The 'Wootz steel making process', widely known in south India and studied by Michael Faraday, was 'completely lost by the mid-nineteenth century'. This was because the 'swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India'. Iron smelting in India generally declined by the late nineteenth century due to 'new forest laws' that prevented smelters from accessing wood for charcoal and iron ore, and due to high taxes imposed for forest access. Additionally, 'iron and steel was being imported from Britain', which 'lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters'. However, the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was set up, beginning steel production in 1912. TISCO's growth was significantly boosted by the First World War (1914), as 'steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe', causing British steel imports into India to 'declined dramatically'. The Indian Railways and the colonial government then turned to TISCO for supplies, leading to its expansion and making it 'the biggest steel industry within the British empire' by 1919 (Section 5).\n\nAnswer: After the mid-19th century, British rule fundamentally altered India's administrative structure by transferring power from the East India Company to the British Crown in 1858, establishing a Secretary of State for India and a Viceroy, assuring ruling chiefs of non-annexation while asserting British paramountcy, restructuring the army, confiscating Muslim land, and protecting landlords. Concurrently, the indigenous steel industry faced significant decline; the Wootz steel-making process was lost, and local iron smelting dwindled due to British conquest, imports of British steel, and restrictive forest laws. However, the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) emerged and expanded significantly during World War I when British steel imports decreased, leading to TISCO becoming the largest steel industry within the British Empire."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.5.5", "6.4.11", "6.2.10", "6.1.1", "8.6.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants.

However, after independence the Congress did not take any steps to honour this promise. For India had been divided on the basis of religion: despite the wishes and efforts of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom had come not to one nation but to two. As a result of the partition of India, more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims. Could the country afford further divisions on the basis of language? \nBoth Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel were against the creation of linguistic states. After the Partition, Nehru said, \u201cdisruptionist tendencies had come to the fore\u201d; to check them, the nation had to be strong and united. Or, as Patel put it: ... the first and last need of India at the present moment is that it should be made a nation \u2026 Everything which helps the growth of nationalism has to go forward and everything which throws obstacles in its way has to be rejected \u2026 We have applied this test to linguistic provinces also, and by this test, in our opinion [they] cannot be supported. \nThat the Congress leaders would now go back on their promise created great disappointment. The Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, the Marathi speakers, had all looked forward to having their own state. The strongest protests, however, came from the Telugu-speaking districts of what was the Madras Presidency. When Nehru went to campaign there during the general elections of 1952, he was met with black flags and slogans demanding \u201cWe want Andhra\u201d. In October of that year, a veteran Gandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger strike demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast went on, it attracted much support. Hartals and bandhs were observed in many towns. \nOn 15 December 1952, fifty-eight days into his fast, Potti Sriramulu died. As a newspaper put it, \u201cthe news of the passing away of Sriramulu engulfed entire Andhra in chaos\u201d. The protests were so widespread and intense that the central government was forced to give in to the demand. Thus, on 1 October 1953, the new state of Andhra came into being, which subsequently became Andhra Pradesh. \nAfter the creation of Andhra, other linguistic communities also demanded their own separate states. A States Reorganisation Commission was set up, which submitted its report in 1956, recommending the redrawing of district and provincial boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu speakers respectively. The large Hindi-speaking region of north India was also to be broken up into several states. A little later, in 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided into separate states for Marathi and Gujarati speakers. In 1966, the state of Punjab was also divided into Punjab and Haryana, the former for the Punjabi speakers (who were also mostly Sikhs), the latter for the rest (who spoke not Punjabi but versions of Haryanvi or Hindi). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for the initial reluctance of the Indian National Congress leaders to form states based on linguistic groups after independence, and how did the British Company's motivations for reforming vernacular education differ in their approach to existing local systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Reasons for Congress's reluctance:** The text explicitly states that after independence, the Congress did not honor its promise of linguistic provinces because \"India had been divided on the basis of religion\" which resulted in \"more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims.\" Both Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel opposed linguistic states, emphasizing that \"the nation had to be strong and united\" to counter \"disruptionist tendencies.\" Patel further stated that \"the first and last need of India at the present moment is that it should be made a nation\u2026 Everything which helps the growth of nationalism has to go forward.\" By this test, linguistic provinces \"cannot be supported.\" \n2. **British Company's motivations for education reform:** The text explains that the Company initially \"allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference\" until the mid-nineteenth century, being \"concerned primarily with higher education.\" However, \"After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education.\" Their motivation was to introduce \"order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections.\" This indicates a desire for standardization and control over the existing flexible system, rather than a concern about national division. \n3. **Difference in motivations:** The Congress leaders' reluctance was primarily driven by a fear of further national fragmentation and a strong desire for national unity following the violent religious partition. In contrast, the British Company's motivation for educational reform was to impose a standardized, regulated structure and 'order' on the previously flexible indigenous education system, which they viewed as needing improvement, rather than to prevent national division.\n\nAnswer: The Indian National Congress leaders were initially reluctant to form linguistic states due to the recent traumatic Partition of India on religious lines, fearing further national division and prioritizing a strong, united nation. The British Company's motivations for reforming vernacular education, however, differed as they sought to introduce \"order,\" \"routines,\" and \"rules\" to standardize and control the existing flexible local pathshala system, rather than being driven by concerns of national fragmentation."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.10.3", "8.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This was an age when Islam, Brahmanical Hinduism, Sufism, various strands of bhakti, and the Nathpanths, Siddhas and Yogis influenced one another. We saw that new towns (Chapter 6) and kingdoms (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new professions and finding new roles for themselves. Such people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and labourers, thronged to listen to these new saints and spread their ideas. \nSome of them like Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak rejected all orthodox religions. Others like Tulsidas and Surdas accepted existing beliefs and practices but wanted to make these accessible to all. Tulsidas conceived of God in the form of Rama. Tulsidas\u2019s composition, the Ramcharitmanas, written in Awadhi (a language used in eastern Uttar Pradesh), is important both as an expression of his devotion and as a literary work. Surdas was an ardent devotee of Krishna. His compositions, compiled in the Sursagara, Surasaravali and Sahitya Lahari, express his devotion. Also contemporary was Shankaradeva of Assam (late fifteenth century) who emphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems and plays in Assamese. He began the practice of setting up namghars or houses of recitation and prayer, a practice that continues to date. \nThe essence of Shankaradeva\u2019s devotion came to be known as Eka Sarana Nama Dharma (supreme surrender to the One). The teachings of Shankaradeva were based on the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavata Purana. He also encouraged the establishment of satra or monasteries for transmission of knowledge. His major compositions included Kirtana-ghosha. \nThis tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal, Ravidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth century. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint from a caste considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d. She was devoted to Krishna and composed innumerable bhajans expressing her intense devotion. Her songs also openly challenged the norms of the \u201cupper\u201d castes and became popular with the masses in Rajasthan and Gujarat. \nA unique feature of most of the saints is that their works were composed in regional languages and could be sung. They became immensely popular and were handed down orally from generation to generation. Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and women transmitted these songs, often adding their own experiences. Thus the songs as we have them today are as much a creation of the saints as of generations of people who sang them. They have become a part of our living popular culture. \nThis is a song composed by Mirabai: Ranaji, I have left your norms of shame, and false decorum of the princely life. I have left your town. And yet Rana why have you kept up enmity against me? Rana you gave me a cup of poison. I drank it laughing. Rana I will not be destroyed by you. And yet Rana why have you kept up enmity against me? \nAn important contribution of Bhakti saints was towards the development of music. Jayadeva of Bengal composed the Gita Govinda in Sanskrit, each song composed in a particular raga and tala. A significant impact that these saints had on music was the use of bhajan, kirtan and abhang. These songs which emphasised on emotional experience had a tremendous appeal to the common people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFrom the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns. These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain. Some of these taxes were collected in kind, while others were collected in cash. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Agenda for a National Education \n\n British officials were not the only people thinking about education in India. From the early nineteenth century many thinkers from different parts of India began to talk of the need for a wider spread of education. Impressed with the developments in Europe, some Indians felt that Western education would help modernise India. They urged the British to open more schools, colleges and universities, and spend more money on education. There were other Indians, however, who reacted against Western education. Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore were two such individuals. Let us look at what they had to say. \n\u201cEnglish education has enslaved us\u201d \n Mahatma Gandhi argued that colonial education created a sense of inferiority in the minds of Indians. It made them see Western civilisation as superior, and destroyed the pride they had in their own culture. There was poison in this education, said Mahatma Gandhi, it was sinful, it enslaved Indians, it cast an evil spell on them. Charmed by the West, appreciating everything that came fr om the West, Indians educated in these institutions began admiring British rule. Mahatma Gandhi wanted an education that could help Indians recover their sense of dignity and self-respect. During the national movement he urged students to leave educational institutions in order to show to the British that Indians were no longer willing to be enslaved. \nMahatma Gandhi strongly felt that Indian languages ought to be the medium of teaching. Education in English crippled Indians, distanced them from their own social surroundings, and made them \u201cstrangers in their own lands\u201d. Speaking a foreign tongue, despising local culture, the English educated did not know how to relate to the masses. \nWestern education, Mahatma Gandhi said, focused on reading and writing rather than oral knowledge; it valued textbooks rather than lived experience and practical knowledge. He argued that education ought to develop a person\u2019s mind and soul. Literacy \u2013 or simply learning to read and write \u2013 by itself did not count as education. People had to work with their hands, learn a craft, and know how different things operated. This would develop their mind and their capacity to understand. As nationalist sentiments spread, other thinkers also began thinking of a system of national education which would be radically different from that set up by the British. \nTagore\u2019s \u201cabode of peace\u201d \n Many of you may have heard of Santiniketan. Do you know why it was established and by whom? Rabindranath Tagore started the institution in 1901. As a child, Tagore hated going to school. He found it suffocating and oppressive. The school appeared like a prison, for he could never do what he felt like doing. So while other children listened to the teacher, Tagore\u2019s mind would wander away. \nThe experience of his schooldays in Calcutta shaped Tagore\u2019s ideas of education. On growing up, he wanted to set up a school where the child was happy, where she could be free and creative, where she was able to explore her own thoughts and desires. Tagore felt that childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside the rigid and restricting discipline of the schooling system set up by the British. Teachers had to be imaginative, understand the child, and help the child develop her curiosity. According to Tagore, the existing schools killed the natural desire of the child to be creative, her sense of wonder. \nTagore was of the view that creative learning could be encouraged only within a natural environment. So he chose to set up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural setting. He saw it as an abode of peace (santiniketan ), where living in harmony with nature, children could cultivate their natural creativity. \nIn many senses Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi thought about education in similar ways. There were, however, differences too. Gandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship of machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements of modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within Indian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and technology at Santiniketan, along with art, music and dance. \nMany individuals and thinkers were thus thinking about the way a national educational system could be fashioned. Some wanted changes within the system set up by the British, and felt that the system could be extended so as to include wider sections of people. Others urged that alternative systems be created so that people were educated into a culture that was truly national. Who was to define what was truly national? The debate about what this \u201cnational education\u201d ought to be continued till after independence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, how did regional languages and traditional Indian knowledge contribute to societal and cultural development during the Bhakti movement and in Mahatma Gandhi's vision for national education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires synthesizing information from two distinct periods discussed in the text: the Bhakti movement (Section 2) and Mahatma Gandhi's educational philosophy (Section 3). \n\n1.  **Bhakti Movement (Section 2):** The text explicitly states that 'A unique feature of most of the saints is that their works were composed in regional languages and could be sung.' Examples include Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas in Awadhi, Shankaradeva's poems and plays in Assamese, and Mirabai's bhajans. These compositions made spiritual ideas 'accessible to all' and became 'immensely popular,' 'handed down orally from generation to generation,' often by 'poorest, most deprived communities and women.' This facilitated the spread of their ideas, challenged 'upper' caste norms (Mirabai), and significantly contributed to the development of music through 'bhajan, kirtan and abhang,' becoming 'a part of our living popular culture.' Thus, regional languages were crucial for mass communication, cultural preservation, and musical innovation.\n\n2.  **Mahatma Gandhi's Vision for National Education (Section 3):** Mahatma Gandhi 'strongly felt that Indian languages ought to be the medium of teaching.' He argued that 'Education in English crippled Indians, distanced them from their own social surroundings, and made them \u201cstrangers in their own lands.\u201d' He also valued 'oral knowledge' and 'lived experience and practical knowledge' over 'textbooks,' advocating that 'People had to work with their hands, learn a craft,' to develop their 'mind and soul.' He believed this approach would help Indians 'recover their sense of dignity and self-respect' and pride in 'their own culture.' Therefore, for Gandhi, regional languages and traditional practical knowledge were essential for maintaining cultural identity, fostering self-respect, and providing holistic education rooted in local context.\n\nIn summary, both periods highlight the critical role of regional languages and traditional knowledge in empowering people, preserving culture, and fostering a sense of identity, albeit in different societal contexts (religious-cultural spread versus national education).\n\nAnswer: During the Bhakti movement, regional languages were vital for saints like Tulsidas, Shankaradeva, and Mirabai to compose and spread devotional ideas, making them accessible to common people and challenging social norms through popular songs and oral traditions. In Mahatma Gandhi's vision for national education, Indian languages were deemed essential as the medium of teaching to prevent cultural alienation, foster self-respect, and connect individuals to their social surroundings. He also emphasized traditional practical knowledge and crafts as fundamental to developing a person's mind and soul, advocating for an education rooted in lived experience rather than solely textbooks."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.4", "7.8.9", "8.7.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Take a look at Table 1 again and identify the five dynasties that together made the Delhi Sultanate. \nThe rulers of Delhi - Table 1 - RAJPUT DYNASTIES : Tomaras Early twelfth century-1165, Ananga Pala 1130-1145, Chauhans 1165-1192, Prithviraj Chauhan 1175-1192 - EARLY TURKISH RULERS 1206-1290 : Qutbuddin Aybak 1206-1210, Shamsuddin Iltutmish 1210-1236, Raziyya 1236-1240, Ghiyasuddin Balban 1266-1287 - KHALJI DYNASTY 1290-1320 : Jalaluddin Khalji 1290-1296, Alauddin Khalji 1296-1316 - TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 1320-1414 : Ghiyasuddin Tughluq 1320-1324, Muhammad Tughluq 1324-1351, Firuz Shah Tughluq 1351-1388 - SAYYID DYNASTY 1414-1451 : Khizr Khan 1414-1421 - LODI DYNASTY 1451-1526 : Bahlul Lodi 1451-1489 \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments. Among them were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis. They advocated renunciation of the world. To them the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realisation of oneness with it. To achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation. These groups became particularly popular among \u201clow\u201d castes. Their criticism of conventional religion created the ground for devotional religion to become a popular force in northern India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHow did the Cholas rise to power? A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the various types of local assemblies in the Pallava and Chola periods, and elaborate on the detailed organizational structure and membership requirements of the sabha during the Chola era."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify Pallava Assemblies:** The first text section explicitly mentions the local assemblies during the Pallava period: the `sabha` (assembly of brahmin landowners), the `ur` (village assembly for non-brahmin landowners), and the `nagaram` (organization of merchants).\n2. **Identify Chola Assemblies:** The second text section describes local assemblies in the Chola period, noting that `ur` were settlements of peasants which, when grouped, formed `nadu` for administrative functions.

Members for these committees were selected by drawing lots, where names written on palm leaf tickets were placed in a pot, and a young boy drew them out.\n4. **Detail Sabha Membership Requirements (Chola):** The Uttaramerur inscription also lays down strict criteria for `sabha` membership: prospective members had to be owners of land from which revenue was collected, possess their own homes, be between 35 and 70 years of age, have knowledge of the Vedas, be well-versed in administrative matters, and be honest. Disqualifications included having served on any committee in the last three years or failing to submit accounts (for themselves or relatives).\n\nAnswer: During the Pallava period, the local assemblies included the `sabha` (for brahmin landowners), the `ur` (for non-brahmin landowners), and the `nagaram` (for merchants). In the Chola period, `ur` referred to peasant settlements, and groups of these formed `nadu` which performed administrative functions. `Nagarams` were associations of traders that also performed administrative roles. The Chola `sabha` was an assembly of prominent Brahmana landholders, particularly overseeing `brahmadeya` lands.\n\nThe Chola `sabha` was highly organized, operating through separate subcommittees responsible for areas like irrigation works, gardens, and temples. Members for these committees were chosen by drawing lots from palm leaf tickets. Eligibility for `sabha` membership required individuals to be landowners paying land revenue, own their homes, be between 35 and 70 years old, possess knowledge of the Vedas, be proficient in administrative matters, and be honest. Disqualifications included having served on a committee in the preceding three years or failing to submit personal or familial accounts."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.11.9", "7.2.5", "7.7.4", "7.3.1", "7.8.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

People stopped living in many of the cities. Writing, seals and weights were no longer used. Raw materials brought from long distances became rare. In Mohenjodaro, we find that garbage piled up on the streets, the drainage system broke down, and new, less impressive houses were built, even over the streets. \nWhy did all this happen? We are not sure. Some scholars suggest that the rivers dried up. Others suggest that there was deforestation. This could have happened because fuel was required for baking bricks, and for smelting copper ores. Besides, grazing by large herds of cattle, sheep and goat may have destroyed the green cover. In some areas there were floods. But none of these reasons can explain the end of all the cities. Flooding, or a river drying up would have had an effect in only some areas. \nIt appears as if the rulers lost control. In any case, the effects of the change are quite clear. Sites in Sind and west Punjab (present-day Pakistan) were abandoned, while many people moved into newer, smaller settlements to the east and the south. \nNew cities emerged about 1400 years later. You will read about them in Chapters 6 and 9. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs traders journeyed to distant lands in caravans and ships, pilgrims often travelled with them. Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found some of the things hunter-gatherers made and used. It is likely that people made and used tools of stone, wood and bone, of which stone tools have survived best. \nSome of these stone tools were used to cut meat and bone, scrape bark (from trees) and hides (animal skins), chop fruit and roots. Some may have been attached to handles of bone or wood, to make spears and arrows for hunting. Other tools were used to chop wood, which was used as firewood. Wood was also used to make huts and tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what was the significance of Kanchipuram, and which Chinese Buddhist pilgrim was approximately contemporary with the ruling dynasties associated with this city?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Significance of Kanchipuram:** The third text section explicitly states that Kanchipuram was 'the capital' of the Pallavas. It further highlights its importance by mentioning that when the Chalukya ruler Pulakeshin II attacked the Pallava king, the king 'took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram,' indicating its role as a key, fortified city for the Pallava dynasty.\n2. **Contemporary Pilgrim:** The third section describes the Pallavas and Chalukyas as 'the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period.' The first text section identifies Xuan Zang as a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim 'who came around 1400 years ago.' By correlating these timeframes, Xuan Zang would be approximately contemporary with the Pallava dynasty and the city of Kanchipuram.\n\nAnswer: Kanchipuram was the capital of the Pallava dynasty, serving as an important and fortified city where the Pallava king sought refuge during an attack by Pulakeshin II. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuan Zang, who came around 1400 years ago, was approximately contemporary with the ruling dynasties associated with Kanchipuram."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.5", "6.2.2", "6.11.6", "6.4.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations. They were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe iron pillar at Mehrauli, Delhi, is a remarkable example of the skill of Indian crafts persons. It is made of iron, 7.2. m high, and weighs over 3 tonnes. It was made about 1500 years ago. We know the date because there is an inscription on the pillar mentioning a ruler named Chandra, who probably belonged to the Gupta dynasty (Chapter 11). What is amazing is the fact that the pillar has not rusted in all these years. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What was the Rowlatt Act, and how did Rabindranath Tagore express his pain and anger following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, specifically referencing an honour defined in the text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed.

Several battles were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda Bahadur\u2019s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. \nUnder a number of able leaders in the eighteenth century, the Sikhs organized themselves into a number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. Their combined forces were known as the grand army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as \u201cresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)\u201d. A system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. \nGuru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega khalsa). Their well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the same inscription as the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur. \nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were divided under different rulers. One of them, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and established his capital at Lahore in 1799. \nTowards the end of the 17th century a powerful state started emerging in the Deccan under the leadership of Shivaji which finally led to the establishment of the Maratha state. Shivaji was born to Shahji and Jija Bai at Shivneri in 1630. Under the guidance of his mother and his guardian Dada Konddev, Shivaji embarked on a career of conquest at a young age. The occupation of Javli made him the undisputed leader of the Mavala highlands which paved the way for further expansion. His exploits against the forces of Bijapur and the Mughals made him a legendary figure. He often resorted to guerrilla warfare against his opponents. By introducing an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi he laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state. \nThe Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasantpastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji\u2019s death, effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji\u2019s successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom. \nBaji Rao I, also known as Baji Rao Ballal was the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath. He was a great Maratha general who is credited to have expanded the Maratha kingdom beyond the Vindhyas and is known for his military campaigns against Malwa, Bundelkhand, Gujarat and the Portugese. \nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very successful military organisation. Their success lay in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed. \nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region. \nChauth : 25 per cent of the land revenue claimed by zamindars. In the Deccan this was collected by the Marathas. Sardeshmukhi : 9-10 per cent of the land revenue paid to the head revenue collector in the Deccan. \nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south (see Map 1). These were not formally included in the Maratha empire, but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, but it came at a price. These military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well. Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under Sindhia\u2019s patronage and Indore under Holkar\u2019s. By all accounts these cities were large and prosperous and functioned as important commercial and cultural centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and Allahabad in the east. \nLike the other states the Jats consolidated their power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra. \nThe power of the Jats reached its zenith under Suraj Mal who consolidated the Jat state at Bharatpur (in present day Rajasthan) during 1756-1763. The areas under the political control of Suraj Mal broadly included parts of modern eastern Rajasthan, southern Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Suraj Mal built a number of forts and palaces and the famous Lohagarh fort in Bharatpur is regarded as one of the strongest forts built in this region. \nThe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, many of the city\u2019s notables took refuge there. His son Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to fight the Mughals. \nWhile the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first associated with royalty under Shah Jahan (see Figure 12 in Chapter 5 and Figure 12 in Chapter 9). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What methods did the Sikhs and Marathas employ to assert their sovereign rule and what were the distinct administrative or military strategies that contributed to the growth of their respective states?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer the question, I will first identify the methods used by the Sikhs to assert their sovereign rule, then detail their administrative and military strategies.

Their \"well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali.\"\n3.  **Marathas' assertion of sovereign rule:** The text indicates that by the 1730s, \"the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.\" Furthermore, territories expanded into paid \"tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty,\" even if not formally included in the empire.\n4.  **Marathas' administrative and military strategies:** Shivaji laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state by introducing \"an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi.\" The \"peasant-pastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army.\" Under the Peshwas, they developed a \"very successful military organisation\" by \"bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed.\" Administratively, once rule was secure, \"revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account,\" and \"Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived.\"\n\nAnswer: The Sikhs asserted their sovereign rule by striking coins in the names of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, initially under Banda Bahadur and again in 1765. Their state-building strategies included organizing into bands called jathas and misls, forming a grand army (dal khalsa), making collective decisions (gurmatas), and implementing the 'rakhi' system for tax collection and protection. The Marathas, on the other hand, asserted sovereignty through their king being recognized as the overlord of the Deccan peninsula, possessing the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi, and by making other regions pay tribute. Their strategies included Shivaji's efficient administrative system based on chauth and sardeshmukhi, utilizing peasant-pastoralists (kunbis) as the army's backbone, and developing a military organization that bypassed fortified areas, raided cities, and disrupted Mughal supply lines. Under the Peshwas, they also encouraged agriculture, revived trade, and developed an effective administrative system that adapted revenue demands to local conditions."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.10.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

People said he had miraculous powers \u2013 he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve all their problems. \nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas \u2013 a tribal group that lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region \u2013 Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be in danger. \nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? Who were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter. You have read about tribal societies last year. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nOrdinary people also told stories, composed poems and songs, sang, danced, and performed plays. Some of these are preserved in collections of stories such as the Jatakas and the Panchatantra, which were written down around this time. Stories from the Jatakas were often shown on the railings of stupas and in paintings in places such as Ajanta. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what factors contributed to Birsa Munda's rise as a revered figure among the tribal communities in Chottanagpur, and what specific problems were his followers experiencing under British rule that he aimed to address?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that Birsa Munda gained reverence because people believed he possessed 'miraculous powers \u2013 he could cure all diseases and multiply grain.' Birsa himself declared that 'God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders).' Consequently, thousands began following him, 'believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve all their problems.'

Birsa's mission to save his people and free them from 'dikus' directly aimed to resolve these issues.\n\nAnswer: Birsa Munda became a revered figure because people believed he had miraculous powers, such as curing diseases and multiplying grain, and he declared himself appointed by God to save his people from trouble and free them from 'dikus' (outsiders). His followers, including Mundas, Santhals, and Oraons, were unhappy under British rule as their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be in danger, all of which Birsa aimed to resolve."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.12.8", "8.4.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWith the decline in the authority of the Mughal emperors, the governors of large provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars consolidated their authority in different parts of the subcontinent. Through the eighteenth century, the Mughal Empire gradually fragmented into a number of independent, regional states. Broadly speaking the states of the eighteenth century can be divided into three overlapping groups: (1) States that were old Mughal provinces like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. Although extremely powerful and quite independent, the rulers of these states did not break their formal ties with the Mughal emperor. (2) States that had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals as watan jagirs. These included several Rajput principalities. (3) The last group included states under the control of Marathas, Sikhs and others like the Jats. These were of differing sizes and had seized their independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the methods of political consolidation and expansion employed by Ashoka, the Sangam chiefs, and the successor states of the Mughal Empire, based on the provided texts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Ashoka's Method:** The text states Ashoka fought a war to conquer Kalinga. However, after witnessing the violence, he decided not to fight any more wars, becoming 'the only king in the history of the world who gave up conquest after winning a war.' This indicates an initial method of military expansion followed by a unique renunciation of further conquest. \n2. **Sangam Chiefs' Method:** The text describes the muvendar (Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas) as chiefs who controlled fertile river valleys and coasts. They consolidated power and wealth by 'demanded and received gifts from the people' and by going on 'military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas.' They maintained power by distributing wealth among supporters. \n3. **Mughal Successor States' Methods:** The text explains that with the decline of Mughal authority, 'governors of large provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars consolidated their authority.' The Mughal Empire 'fragmented into a number of independent, regional states.' These states employed different methods: \n    *   Old Mughal provinces (e.g., Awadh, Bengal, Hyderabad) became powerful and independent but 'did not break their formal ties with the Mughal emperor.' \n    *   Watan jagirs (e.g., Rajput principalities) 'had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals.' \n    *   Other states (e.g., Marathas, Sikhs, Jats) 'had seized their independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle.' \nBy comparing these points, the answer will highlight the different strategies for acquiring, maintaining, and relinquishing power.\n\nAnswer: Ashoka initially expanded his empire through military conquest, as demonstrated by his war against Kalinga. However, uniquely, he chose to abandon further conquest after witnessing the bloodshed, making him the only king to do so after a victory. In contrast, the Sangam chiefs (Cholas, Cheras, Pandyas) consolidated their power and wealth by controlling fertile river valleys and coasts, demanding gifts from their populace, and collecting tribute through military expeditions against neighboring regions. They maintained their authority by distributing collected wealth among their supporters. The successor states of the Mughal Empire consolidated power through varied means following the empire's fragmentation. Some, like the rulers of Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad, were powerful governors of old Mughal provinces who became independent but retained formal ties with the emperor. Others, such as various Rajput principalities, had already enjoyed significant independence as watan jagirs under the Mughals. A third group, including the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats, seized their independence from the Mughals after prolonged armed struggles."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.6", "6.2.11", "7.10.3", "6.10.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nXuan Zang, and other pilgrims spent time studying in Nalanda, (Bihar) the most famous Buddhist monastery of the period.

The authors of tawarikh were learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. \nThe circle of justice - Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century: A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king promotes justice and honest governance. \nKeep the following additional details in mind: (1) the authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. (3) These authors advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared by everybody. \nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmish\u2019s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. She was removed from the throne in 1240. \nBirthright - Privileges claimed on account of birth. For example, people believed that nobles inherited their rights to govern, because they were born in certain families. Gender distinctions - Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women. \nWhat Minhaj-i Siraj thought about Raziyya? Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore asked: \u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi (1262- 1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in Kashmir (980- 1003). Her title is interesting: it comes from \u201cdidi\u201d or \u201celder sister\u201d, an obviously affectionate term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were Minhaj-i Siraj's concerns about Raziyya's rule, and how did his views reflect the concept of 'gender distinctions' as defined in the text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that Minhaj-i Siraj, the chronicler, 'recognised that she [Raziyya] was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler.' This indicates his primary concern was her gender, despite her capabilities. The text further explains his reasoning: 'Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men.' He even posed a rhetorical question: '\u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d' This clearly shows his belief in a divinely ordained hierarchy where men were superior. The text defines 'Gender distinctions' as 'Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women.' Minhaj-i Siraj's discomfort with a female ruler and his belief in women's subordination directly align with this definition, as his views used gender to argue against Raziyya's right to rule, thus asserting male superiority.\n\nAnswer: Minhaj-i Siraj recognized Raziyya's superior ability but was uncomfortable with her rule, believing it contradicted the ideal social order created by God, where women were subordinate to men. His views, which questioned how a woman could effectively rule, directly reflected the concept of 'gender distinctions' by using social and biological differences to argue for male superiority in governance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}
