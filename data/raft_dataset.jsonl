A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that are similar and circle those that are different. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFigure 1 shows the first balcony of the Qutb Minar. Qutbuddin Aybak had this constructed around 1199. Notice the pattern created under the balcony by the small arches and geometrical designs. Can you see two bands of inscriptions under the balcony? These are in Arabic. Notice that the surface of the minar is curved and angular. Placing an inscription on such a surface required great precision. Only the most skilled craftsperson could perform this task. Remember that very few buildings were made of stone or brick 800 years ago. What would have been the impact of a building like the Qutb Minar on observers in the thirteenth century? \nBetween the eighth and the eighteenth centuries kings and their officers built two kinds of structures: the first were forts, palaces, garden residences and tombs \u2013 safe, protected and grandiose places of rest in this world and the next; the second were structures meant for public activity including temples, mosques, tanks, wells, caravanserais and bazaars. Kings were expected to care for their subjects, and by making structures for their use and comfort, rulers hoped to win their praise. Construction activity was also carried out by others, including merchants. They built temples, mosques and wells. However, domestic architecture \u2013 large mansions (havelis) of merchants \u2013 has survived only from the eighteenth century. \nBuilt by Akbar, the Agra Fort required 2,000 stone-cutters, 2,000 cement and lime-makers and 8,000 labourers \nThe Qutb Minar is five storeys high. The band of inscriptions you see are under its first balcony. The first floor was constructed by Qutbuddin Aybak and the rest by Iltutmish around 1229. Over the years it was damaged by lightning and earthquakes and repaired by Alauddin Khalji, Muhammad Tughluq, Firuz Shah Tughluq and Ibrahim Lodi. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what types of structures were built in different historical contexts, who were the primary builders or funders, and what materials were commonly used?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Ancient Cities (First section):** The text describes cities divided into a smaller, higher citadel and a larger, lower town.

Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here.

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were two different aspects of the English East India Company's engagement or interests in India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that 'the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory' and that 'British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products'.

The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen that the earliest people hunted, gathered plant produce, made stone tools, and painted on cave walls. Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, days or years \u2013 as a clock or a calendar. Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFranchise \u2013 The right to vote. \n \nA Constitution is Written \n\n Between December 1946 and November 1949, some three hundred Indians had a series of meetings on the country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key features of the Indian Constitution regarding universal adult franchise and social equality, and who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee responsible for its finalization?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950, had several key features. One significant feature was its adoption of 'universal adult franchise,' allowing all Indians above the age of 21 to vote. This was considered a 'revolutionary step' because, unlike countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States where this right was granted in stages and often restricted by property, education, or gender, India chose to grant it to all citizens 'regardless of gender, class or education' soon after Independence. A second feature was the guarantee of 'equality before the law' to all citizens, irrespective of their caste or religious affiliation, explicitly rejecting the idea of a 'Hindu state' and ensuring equal rights for various religious communities. A third feature addressed social equality by offering 'special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians,' which included the abolition of 'untouchability' and the provision of reservations for 'Scheduled Castes' (formerly Untouchables) and 'adivasis or Scheduled Tribes' in legislatures and government jobs to rectify historical deprivation and discrimination. The text also explicitly identifies 'Dr B.R. Ambedkar' as having played 'perhaps the most important role' as the 'Chairman of the Drafting Committee' under whose supervision the document was finalised.\n\nAnswer: The Indian Constitution adopted universal adult franchise, allowing all Indians over 21 to vote immediately regardless of gender, class, or education, a revolutionary approach compared to other nations. It also guaranteed equality before the law for all citizens irrespective of caste or religious affiliation and provided special privileges for disadvantaged groups by abolishing untouchability and instituting reservations for Scheduled Castes and Tribes.

Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Delhi Sultans' (specifically Iltutmish, Khaljis, and Tughluqs) approach to appointing administrators and maintaining control differ from Akbar's administrative system, particularly regarding the sources of loyalty and potential for instability?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The Delhi Sultans, starting with Iltutmish, favored 'bandagan' (special slaves purchased for military service) and later, the Khaljis and Tughluqs also raised 'people of humble birth' and 'clients' to high political positions like generals and governors. The text states these individuals were 'totally dependent upon their master' and thus the Sultan could 'trust and rely upon them.' However, this system introduced 'an element of political instability' because 'Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs.' This often led to 'conflict between the old and the new nobility' upon a new monarch's accession, and elites criticized the appointment of the 'low and base-born.'\n\nIn contrast, Akbar's administrative system divided the empire into 'subas' (provinces) governed by 'subadars' who performed both political and military functions, supported by other officers like 'diwan,' 'bakhshi,' 'sadr,' 'faujdars,' and 'kotwal.' Akbar's system relied on 'nobles' who 'commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue.' While initially loyal, the text indicates that 'by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own,' and their 'loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest.'\n\nTherefore, the Delhi Sultans' approach focused on personal dependency for loyalty from 'bandagan' and clients, which inherently caused instability upon a change of ruler due to a lack of inherited loyalty. Akbar's system, while more structured with designated roles and powerful nobles, faced instability from the gradual erosion of loyalty among powerful nobles who developed independent interests over time.\n\nAnswer: The Delhi Sultans, particularly Iltutmish, Khaljis, and Tughluqs, appointed 'bandagan' (special slaves) and people of humble birth/clients to high administrative posts. Their loyalty stemmed from personal dependence on their master, leading to political instability as this loyalty did not extend to the Sultan's heirs, causing conflict upon new accessions. In contrast, Akbar's system relied on a structured hierarchy of 'subadars' and 'nobles' who commanded armies and revenues. While initially loyal, the stability of Akbar's system was later threatened as nobles developed independent networks and their loyalties weakened due to self-interest by the late seventeenth century."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.3.4", "7.4.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns.

In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: The Delhi Sultanate faced significant challenges, including the need to maintain large standing armies and external threats like the Mongols. Based on the provided text, describe the distinct administrative and economic strategies employed by Sultan Alauddin Khalji and Sultan Muhammad Tughluq to address these challenges, and also briefly mention how revenue was generally collected under the Delhi Sultanate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires a comparison of administrative and economic strategies of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq, along with a general overview of Delhi Sultanate revenue collection, all based on the provided text. \n\n1.  **Common Challenge:** Both sultans faced increased Mongol attacks and needed to mobilize large standing armies, posing a huge administrative challenge.\n\n2.  **Alauddin Khalji's Strategies:**\n    *   **Garrison Town:** He constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers.\n    *   **Feeding the Army:** Soldiers were fed through produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna, fixed at 50% of the peasant\u2019s yield.\n    *   **Paying the Army:** He paid soldiers cash salaries instead of iqtas. To prevent merchants from raising prices due to increased demand, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were surveyed by officers, and non-compliant merchants were punished. \n    *   **Outcome:** His measures were successful, leading to cheap prices, efficient supplies, and successfully withstanding Mongol invasions.\n\n3.  **Muhammad Tughluq's Strategies:**\n    *   **Initial Context:** He defeated the Mongol army in the early years of his reign and planned an attack on Transoxiana, leading him to raise a large standing army.\n    *   **Garrison Town:** Instead of a new town, he emptied Dehli-i Kuhna (the oldest of Delhi's four cities) of its residents, who were sent to Daulatabad, and garrisoned soldiers there.\n    *   **Feeding the Army:** Produce from the same Ganga-Yamuna area was collected as tax, but additional taxes were levied to meet expenses, coinciding with a famine.\n    *   **Paying the Army:** He also paid soldiers cash salaries but introduced a 'token' currency made of cheap metals. \n    *   **Outcome:** This token currency was not trusted; people saved gold/silver and paid taxes with the cheap tokens, which were also easily counterfeited. His measures were a failure, leading to a disastrous campaign, abandonment of invasion plans, disbanding of the army, resentment over the Daulatabad shift, widespread rebellion due to taxes and famine, and the recall of the token currency.\n\n4.  **General Revenue Collection under Delhi Sultanate:**\n    *   Military commanders (muqtis/iqtadars) collected revenues from their assigned territories (iqtas) as salary and paid their soldiers from these. The state appointed accountants to check revenue collection by muqtis and ensure they collected only prescribed taxes and maintained the required soldiers.\n    *   Under Alauddin Khalji, the state brought land revenue assessment and collection under its own control, cancelling local chieftains' rights to levy taxes and forcing them to pay taxes. Administrators measured land and kept accounts.\n    *   There were three types of taxes: kharaj (on cultivation, about 50% of produce), on cattle, and on houses.\n\nAnswer: Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq employed distinct strategies to manage their large standing armies and external threats. Alauddin Khalji constructed a new garrison town called Siri, fed his army with 50% of peasant's produce as tax from the Ganga-Yamuna region, and paid cash salaries while controlling market prices in Delhi to ensure supplies and prevent inflation. His measures were successful in maintaining cheap prices and repelling Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq, after defeating the Mongols, planned an offensive. He garrisoned his army in Dehli-i Kuhna, displacing its residents to Daulatabad. He levied additional taxes on top of existing ones from the Ganga-Yamuna belt, which coincided with a famine. He also paid cash salaries but introduced a 'token' currency made of cheap metals, which was distrusted, easily counterfeited, and led to people saving gold/silver while paying taxes with the tokens. His administrative measures were a failure, leading to rebellion and the recall of the token currency.\n\nGenerally, under the Delhi Sultanate, revenue was collected by military commanders (muqtis) from their iqtas, who used it as salary and to pay their soldiers. The state appointed accountants to monitor these collections. Alauddin Khalji further centralized revenue collection, cancelling local chieftains' tax-levying rights and imposing three main taxes: kharaj (50% on cultivation), on cattle, and on houses."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.4", "6.5.9", "7.3.4", "7.4.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together. There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago. He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nPaper has become a part of our daily lives.

He beat plant fibres, cloth, rope and the bark of trees, soaked these in water, and then pressed, drained and dried the pulp to create paper. Even today, hand made paper is made through a similar process. \nThe technique of making paper was a closely guarded secret for centuries. It reached Korea about 1400 years ago, and spread to Japan soon after. It was known in Baghdad about 1800 years ago.

If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what methods did the early Indian National Congress utilize to raise public awareness about British rule, and how did a figure like Dadabhai Naoroji, identified as a 'publicist,' embody these efforts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of Indian affairs. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a council to advise him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. Through these measures the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India. \n2. All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as subordinates of the British Crown. \n3. It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4. The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British believed that they were responsible for the rebellion in a big way. \n 5. The British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India. \n 6. Policies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and give them security of rights over their lands. \n Thus a new phase of history began after 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the major administrative and political changes introduced by the British in India after they regained control by the end of 1859?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about the administrative and political changes introduced by the British in India after 1859.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHindu The word \u2018Hindu\u2019, like the term \u2018India\u2019 is derived from the river Indus. It was used by Arabs and Iranians to refer to people who lived to the east of the river, and to their cultural practices, including religious beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what specific actions by the English were perceived as threats to the religious practices of Hindus and Muslims by sepoys, and what is the etymological origin of the term 'Hindu'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text, 'Through the Eyes of the People,' details the perceptions of sepoys regarding British rule.

As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n3 Ruling the Countryside \n\n The Company Becomes the Diwan \n On 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUnlike taxes, which were collected on a regular basis, tribute was collected as and when it was possible from people who gave a variety of things, more or less willingly. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's approach to revenue collection evolve after acquiring the Diwani of Bengal, and what were the major outcomes of these changes for the local population?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The East India Company's approach to revenue collection evolved significantly after it became the Diwan of Bengal on August 12, 1765. Initially, the Company aimed to maximize revenue to finance its purchases of goods, which led to a severe economic crisis in Bengal, including a famine in 1770, as peasants struggled to pay dues and artisans were forced to sell goods at low prices. \n\nTo address this, the Company introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. This system recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars, tasking them with collecting rent and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. The desired outcome was a regular revenue flow and zamindar investment in land improvement. However, the high fixed revenue often caused zamindars to lose their lands, and they often did not invest, while cultivators found the system oppressive due to high rents and insecure land rights.\n\nLater, new systems were devised. In 1822, Holt Mackenzie introduced the Mahalwari Settlement in the North Western Provinces, where revenue was estimated per village (mahal), revised periodically, and collected by the village headman instead of zamindars. Concurrently, in South India, Captain Alexander Read and Thomas Munro developed the Ryotwari (or Munro) system, which involved direct settlements with cultivators (ryots) after surveying their fields individually. \n\nDespite the different approaches, the overall outcome of these new systems was often negative. Driven by the desire for increased income, revenue officials fixed excessively high demands. This resulted in peasants being unable to pay, ryots fleeing the countryside, and many villages becoming deserted.\n\nAnswer: After acquiring the Diwani of Bengal in 1765, the East India Company initially focused on maximizing revenue for trade, leading to an economic crisis and famine in 1770. This prompted the introduction of the Permanent Settlement in 1793, which fixed revenue permanently with zamindars but often led to high rents for cultivators and little investment from zamindars. Subsequently, the Mahalwari Settlement (1822) was introduced in the North Western Provinces, assessing revenue per village, and the Ryotwari System was implemented in the South, making direct settlements with cultivators. A common outcome of these evolving systems was excessively high revenue demands, causing peasants to be unable to pay, ryots to flee, and villages to become deserted."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.4", "7.4.10", "8.3.3", "8.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster.

Let us look at some of these. \nKalidasa is known for his plays depicting life in the king\u2019s court. An interesting feature about these plays is that the king and most brahmins are shown as speaking Sanskrit, while women and men other than the king and brahmins use Prakrit. His most famous play, Abhijnana Shakuntalam, is the story of the love between a king named Dushyanta and a young woman named Shakuntala. We find an interesting description of the plight of a poor fisherman in this play. \nThe Chinese pilgrim Fa Xian noticed the plight of those who were treated as untouchables by the high and mighty. They were expected to live on the outskirts of the city. He writes: \u201cIf such a man enters a town or a market place, he strikes a piece of wood, in order to keep himself separate; people, hearing this sound, know what it means and avoid touching him or brushing against him.\u201d \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHow Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives? \n\n The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIndian Textiles and the World Market \n\n Let us first look at textile production. Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nMost prashastis also mention the ancestors of the ruler. This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full of learned people, including Kalidasa the poet, and Aryabhata the astronomer, about whom you will read more in Chapter 12. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the various ways British colonial rule impacted the livelihoods of Indian weavers and spinners, and similarly, how it altered the traditional lives and economic activities of tribal communities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought will first address the impact on Indian weavers and spinners, drawing information from the 'Indian Textiles and the World Market' section. It will detail the initial dominance of Indian textiles, the subsequent British protective measures like the Calico Act, the imposition of high duties, and the competition from British-made goods, which led to widespread unemployment for Indian weavers and spinners. It will also mention the alternative livelihoods sought by these groups and the eventual rise of Indian cotton mills. Next, the chain of thought will focus on the tribal communities, using information from the 'How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?' section. It will explain how tribal chiefs lost administrative power, how shifting cultivators were pressured to settle, the impact of new forest laws restricting traditional practices, and how traders and moneylenders exploited tribal groups. Finally, it will cover the forced migration of tribals to plantations and mines for meager wages, showcasing the significant disruption to their traditional lives.\n\nAnswer: British colonial rule profoundly impacted the livelihoods of both Indian weavers/spinners and tribal communities. For weavers and spinners, India, initially the world's largest producer of cotton textiles, faced severe decline. European demand for Indian textiles led to a flourishing trade, but by the early eighteenth century, England's wool and silk makers protested, leading to the 1720 Calico Act, which banned printed Indian cotton textiles in England. High duties were imposed on Indian textiles, making exports difficult, and British-made cotton textiles eventually ousted Indian goods from traditional markets. This resulted in thousands of weavers and spinners losing their livelihoods; many became agricultural laborers, migrated to cities or plantations abroad, or later found work in new Indian cotton mills established from 1854 onwards. \n\nSimilarly, tribal communities experienced drastic changes. Tribal chiefs lost much of their administrative power and had to pay tribute to the British. Shifting cultivators were pressured to settle down, and land settlements were introduced, which often led to poor yields for jhum cultivators in dry areas. New forest laws declared forests as state property, restricting jhum cultivation, fruit collection, and hunting, forcing many tribals to seek work elsewhere. Traders and moneylenders exploited tribal groups, particularly silk growers, paying them meager amounts for cocoons sold at five times the price. Many tribals were recruited through contractors to work in tea plantations and coal mines, receiving miserably low wages and being prevented from returning home."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.11.6", "8.6.2", "8.4.3", "6.11.4", "6.11.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

He was a kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha, about which you read in Chapter 6. At the age of thirty, he left home and went to live in a forest. For twelve years he led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment. \nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes. They must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings. \u201cAll beings,\u201d said Mahavira \u201clong to live. To all things life is dear.\u201d Ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers, because they used Prakrit. There were several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of the country, and named after the regions in which they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken in Magadha was known as Magadhi. \nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and were especially asked not to steal. Also, they had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up everything, including their clothes. \nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands left their homes to learn and teach this new way of life. Many more remained behind and supported those who became monks and nuns, providing them with food. \nJainism was supported mainly by traders. Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and his followers were transmitted orally for several centuries. They were written down in the form in which they are presently available at a place called Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see Map 7, page 113). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Rome on Map 6 (page 84). This is one of the oldest cities in Europe, and developed around the same time as the cities in the Ganga valley. Rome was the capital of one of the largest empires \u2014 one that spread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Augustus, one of the most important emperors, who ruled about 2000 years ago, said that he found Rome a city of brick, and made it into a city of marble. He, and later rulers, built temples and palaces. \nThey also built huge amphitheatres \u2014 open arenas surrounded by tiers of seats \u2014 where citizens could watch all kinds of shows, and public baths (with separate timings for men and women), where people met and relaxed.

Let us look at the example of Mathura (Map 7, page 113). \nMathura has been an important settlement for more than 2500 years. It was important because it was located at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south. There were fortifications around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food for people in the city. Mathura was also a centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced. \nAround 2000 years ago Mathura became the second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you will be reading in Chapter 10. Mathura was also a religious centre \u2014 there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and it was an important centre for the worship of Krishna.ks \nmoSeveral inscriptions on surfaces such as stone slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to monasteries and shrines.

For instance, inscriptions from Mathura mention goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers.ks \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary purposes of the public structures built in ancient Rome, and what factors contributed to Mathura's significance as a settlement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes the primary purposes of public structures in ancient Rome.

The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \nBy 1857 the Company came to exercise direct rule over about 83 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the primary governing authorities and key societal roles in the Harappan and Later Vedic periods, and explain how the East India Company's role in India evolved by 1857."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for three distinct pieces of information from the provided texts. \n1.

Many of these were inscribed several hundreds of years ago. All inscriptions contain both scripts and languages. Languages which were used, as well as scripts, have changed over time. So how do scholars understand what was inscribed? This can be done through a process known as decipherment \nOne of the most famous stories of decipherment comes from Egypt, a country in north Africa where there were kings and queens about 5000 years ago. \nRosetta is a town on the north coast of Egypt, and here an inscribed stone was found, which contained inscriptions in three different languages and scripts (Greek, and two forms of Egyptian). Scholars who could read Greek figured out that the names of kings and queens were enclosed in a little frame, called a cartouche. They then placed the Greek and the Egyptian signs side by side, and identified the sounds for which the Egyptian letters stood. As you can see, a lion stood for L, and a bird for A.

Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAround the time when Jainism and Buddhism were becoming popular, brahmins developed the system of ashramas. Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found seeds of wheat, barley, rice, pulses, millets, peas and sesame. Bones of a number of animals, many bearing cut marks that show they may have been used as food, have also been found. These include cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, dog, horse, ass, pig, sambhar, spotted deer, blackbuck, antelope, hare, and mongoose, besides birds, crocodile, turtle, crab and fish. There is evidence that fruits such as ber, amla, jamun, dates and a variety of berries were collected. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the British Company's reforms to vernacular education after 1854 impact the accessibility of schooling for children from poor peasant families, in contrast to the earlier pathshala system described by William Adam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text first describes the pre-British pathshala system, noting its flexibility, including classes not being held during harvest time. This flexibility meant that 'even children of peasant families could study.' (from 'What Happened to the Local Schools?' section). After 1854, the British Company introduced 'new routines, new rules' to vernacular education, which included demanding 'regular attendance' and a 'regular timetable.' The text explicitly states that 'The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields.' Consequently, 'Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn.' This indicates that the new, rigid system significantly reduced the accessibility of education for poor peasant children, who could no longer balance schooling with their necessary labor during harvest, unlike the earlier flexible system.\n\nAnswer: The British Company's reforms after 1854, which introduced regular attendance and timetables, negatively impacted the accessibility of schooling for children from poor peasant families. The earlier pathshala system was flexible, allowing children to work in the fields during harvest and still attend school. However, the new system's demand for regular attendance, even during harvest time, meant that poor children who had to work were unable to attend, and their absence was viewed as indiscipline, thereby making education less accessible to them."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.7.9", "6.2.4", "6.5.10", "8.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed.

At that time a new international body \u2013 the United Nations \u2013 formed in 1945 was in its infancy.The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of the Cold War, that is, power rivalries and ideological conflicts between the USA and the USSR, with both countries creating military alliances. This was also the period when colonial empires were collapsing and many countries were attaining independence. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was also the foreign minister of newly independent India, developed free India\u2019s foreign policy in this context. Non-alignment formed the bedrock of this foreign policy. \nLed by statesmen from Egypt, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Ghana and India, the non-aligned movement urged countries not to join either of the two major alliances. But this policy of staying away from alliances was not a matter of remaining \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d. The former means remaining aloof from world affairs whereas non-aligned countries such as India played an active role in mediating between the American and Soviet alliances. They tried to prevent war \u2014 often taking a humanitarian and moral stand against war. However, for one reason or another, many non-aligned countries including India got involved in wars.

They were obligated to 'bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support'. It also notes that as they gained 'power and wealth', they would declare themselves 'maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara' and 'sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords'. The example of Dantidurga overthrowing his Chalukya overlord and performing the 'hiranya-garbha' ritual is provided as an instance of asserting independence.\n2.  **For the urban planning and architectural elements (Section 3):** The text describes ancient cities as often divided into 'two or more parts': a 'smaller but higher' western part called the 'citadel' and a 'larger but lower' eastern part called the 'lower town'.

In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago.

They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFa Xian began his journey back home from Bengal.

The merchants began throwing their merchandise overboard so as to lighten the load and save the ship from sinking. Fa Xian threw away his meagre personal belongings, but clung to his books and the statues of the Buddha that he had collected. Finally, the storm subsided after 13 days. This is how he describes the sea: \u201cThe sea itself is boundless in extent \u2014 it is impossible to know east or west, except by observing the sun, moon, or stars in their motions. If it is dark, rainy weather, the only plan is to steer by the wind.\u201d It took him more than 90 days to reach Java, where he halted for five months, before boarding another merchant ship that took him to China. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle, children (especially sons), and horses. Horses were yoked to chariots that were used in battles, which were fought to capture cattle. Battles were also fought for land, which was important for pasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened quickly, such as barley. Some battles were fought for water, and to capture people. \nSome of the wealth that was obtained was kept by the leaders, some was given to the priests and the rest was distributed amongst the people. Some wealth was used for the performance of yajnas or sacrifices in which offerings were made into the fire. These were meant for gods and goddesses. Offerings could include ghee, grain, and in some cases, animals. \nMost men took part in these wars. There was no regular army, but there were assemblies where people met and discussed matters of war and peace. They also chose leaders, who were often brave and skilful warriors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the primary methods used by various rulers, such as Rajarajadeva, Muslim Sultans, and Akbar, to demonstrate their power, wealth, and legitimacy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

All three states were founded by members of the high Mughal nobility who had been governors of large provinces \u2013 Sa\u2018adat Khan (Awadh), Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad). All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both Asaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Sa\u2018adat Khan\u2019s zat was 6,000. \nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state (1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had already gained control over its political and financial administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the actual ruler of that region. \nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. \nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2). \nA description of the Nizam of Hyderabad\u2019s personal troopers in 1790: \u2026The Nizam has a swaree (sawari) of 400 elephants, several thousand of horsemen near his person who receive upwards 100 R(upees)s nominal pay (and) are extremely well mounted and richly caparisoned \nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire. Awadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. In other words, he was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh. \nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawab\u2019s court. He seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand. \nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past. \nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Like the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars. \nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenthcentury Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars. The close connection between the state and bankers \u2013 noticeable in Hyderabad and Awadh as well \u2013 was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756). During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous. \nIf we take a bird\u2019s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states. First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably. The third common feature in all these regional states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nYou may have noticed how wealth is measured in terms of coins in the story on page 90. Archaeologists have found several thousands of coins belonging to this period. The earliest coins which were in use for about 500 years were punch marked coins, \nPunch-marked coins were generally rectangular or sometimes square or round in shape, either cut out of metal sheets or made out of flattened metal globules (a small spherical body). The coins were not inscribed, but were stamped with symbols using dies or punches. Hence, they are called punch-marked coins. These coins are found over most parts of the subcontinent and remained in circulation till the early centuries CE. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were two major changes in agriculture around this time. One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the administrative strategies employed by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq in response to the Mongol threat and for managing their large armies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text in the third section provides distinct administrative measures taken by both Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq concerning the Mongol threat and army management.\n2. For Alauddin Khalji, the text states he 'constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers'. To feed them, 'produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna' was used, with 'Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield'. He 'chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash' and to prevent inflation, 'Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi', punishing non-compliant merchants. His measures were 'quite successful' and he 'successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions'.\n3. For Muhammad Tughluq, the text indicates he 'raised a large standing army' after an initial Mongol defeat, with plans for an offensive. Instead of a new town, 'the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there', sending residents to Daulatabad. 'Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army', but he 'levied additional taxes', coinciding with a famine. He also 'paid his soldiers cash salaries' but 'used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency' made of cheap metals, which 'People in the fourteenth century did not trust' and which 'could also be counterfeited easily'. His measures 'were a failure', leading to resentment, rebellion, and the recall of the token currency. The text also highlights that Tughluq's measures were 'conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols', unlike Alauddin's defensive ones.\n4. The comparison reveals differences in housing soldiers (new town vs. emptying old city), tax collection (fixed vs. additional during famine), currency policy (price control vs. token currency), and the overall outcome (successful defense vs. failed offensive and administrative complications).\n\nAnswer: Alauddin Khalji responded to the Mongol threat by constructing a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. He fed his army by collecting tax, fixed at 50 percent of the peasant\u2019s yield, from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. He paid his soldiers cash salaries and prevented price inflation by controlling the prices of goods in Delhi, punishing merchants who did not comply. His measures were successful in withstanding Mongol invasions.\n\nIn contrast, Muhammad Tughluq, after an initial Mongol defeat, raised a large standing army with an offensive plan. He housed his soldiers by emptying the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) and relocating its residents to Daulatabad. He collected produce as tax from the same area to feed the army but levied additional taxes, which coincided with a famine. He also paid cash salaries but introduced a 'token' currency made of cheap metals, which was distrusted and easily counterfeited. Muhammad Tughluq's administrative measures were largely a failure, leading to widespread rebellion, resentment, and the recall of the token currency."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.9.6", "6.12.3", "7.3.4", "7.10.4", "6.6.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMercantile \u2013 A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices \nEast India Company Comes East \n\n In 1800, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAround 3500 years ago, we find some of the first evidence of writing in China. \nThese writings were on animal bones. These are called oracle bones, because they were used to predict the future. Kings got scribes to write questions on the bones \u2014 would they win battles? Would the harvest be good? Would they have sons? The bones were then put into the fire, and they cracked because of the heat. Then fortunetellers studied these cracks, and tried to predict the future. As you may expect, they sometimes made mistakes. \nThese kings lived in palaces in cities. They amassed vast quantities of wealth, including large, elaborately decorated bronze vessels. However, they did not know the use of iron. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's evolving strategy, from primarily trade to integrating political and administrative control, contribute to the decline of Masulipatnam as a significant port?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text indicates that Masulipatnam was a crucial and active port in the seventeenth century, with both the Dutch and English East India Companies vying for control. However, the Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda tried to limit European control through royal monopolies, and competition was intense among various trading groups. Following the Mughal annexation of Golconda in 1686-1687, European Companies began searching for alternative trade locations. The English East India Company then adopted a 'new policy' where its trade centers were expected to combine political, administrative, and commercial functions, moving beyond merely having access to production centers. This strategic shift, driven by the Company's increasing involvement in political affairs (as evidenced by its actions in Bengal, such as fortifying settlements, acquiring zamindari rights, and eventually gaining the Diwani after events like the Battle of Plassey, allowing it to use local revenues to finance its trade and military), meant that ports like Masulipatnam, which did not offer such integrated control, became less appealing. Consequently, the Company's traders relocated to centers like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, which were being developed to serve these combined political, administrative, and commercial roles, directly causing Masulipatnam to lose its merchants and prosperity and decline during the eighteenth century.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company's strategic shift to integrate political and administrative control with commercial roles, particularly after the Mughal annexation of Golconda, led it to abandon Masulipatnam. The Company sought new centers like Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras where it could establish comprehensive control, thereby diverting trade and merchants away from Masulipatnam and causing its decline."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.2.2", "6.5.11", "7.6.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period. At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction. Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the evolution of British educational policy in India from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, highlighting the key debates and policy shifts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The evolution of British educational policy in India can be traced through several phases as detailed in the 'Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation' section. \n\n1.  **Late 18th Century - Orientalism:** Initially, figures like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, and Nathaniel Halhed, known as Orientalists, held a deep respect for ancient Indian culture. They believed Indian civilization had declined and sought to revive it by discovering, studying, and translating ancient Indian texts (Sanskrit and Persian). Their aim was to help the British learn from Indian culture and for Indians to rediscover their heritage. This led to the establishment of institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781 to promote Arabic, Persian, and Islamic law, and the Hindu College in Benaras in 1791 for ancient Sanskrit texts. They felt the British should promote Indian learning, not Western, to win the hearts of the 'natives'.\n\n2.  **Early 19th Century - Criticism of Orientalism:** From the early 19th century, a shift occurred. Critics like James Mill argued that Eastern knowledge was full of errors, unscientific, and impractical. He advocated that British education should focus on teaching what was useful and practical, specifically Western scientific and technical advances, rather than Eastern poetry or sacred literature.\n\n3.  **1830s - Macaulay's Influence and English Education Act:** The criticism intensified by the 1830s with Thomas Babington Macaulay being a prominent voice. He viewed India as uncivilised and believed Eastern knowledge was vastly inferior to European learning. Macaulay strongly advocated for teaching the English language, arguing it would allow Indians access to world literature, Western science, and philosophy, thereby 'civilising' them. His 'minute' led to the **English Education Act of 1835**. This act made English the medium of instruction for higher education and stopped the promotion of Oriental institutions, which were now seen as 'temples of darkness'.\n\n4.  **Mid-19th Century - Wood's Despatch (1854) and Commercial Focus:** The policy was further shaped by Wood's Despatch in 1854. Issued by Charles Wood, it re-emphasized the practical benefits of European learning. A key aspect was economic: European education would help Indians understand the advantages of trade and commerce, develop the country's resources, and by changing their tastes, create demand for British goods. This period saw the establishment of education departments and universities in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay in 1857.\n\n5.  **Parallel Debate - Missionary Education:** Simultaneously, Christian missionaries argued for moral education through Christianity, believing it would improve people's character. However, the East India Company initially opposed this, fearing it would provoke local reaction. After 1857, the British government also remained reluctant to directly support missionary education to avoid offending 'native' opinion.\n\nIn summary, British educational policy evolved from a respectful promotion of ancient Indian learning (Orientalism) to a strong condemnation of it in favor of practical Western knowledge and English language instruction (Macaulay and English Education Act), finally settling on a policy that also explicitly linked European education to economic and commercial benefits for the British Empire (Wood's Despatch).\n\nAnswer: British educational policy in India evolved through distinct phases from the late 18th to the mid-19th century. Initially, Orientalists like William Jones (late 18th century) advocated for the study and promotion of ancient Indian texts and languages (Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic), establishing institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa (1781) and Hindu College Benaras (1791) out of respect for India's past glory. However, by the early 19th century, critics like James Mill began to argue against Oriental learning, deeming it unscientific and impractical, advocating instead for useful Western knowledge. This criticism intensified with Thomas Babington Macaulay in the 1830s, who vehemently asserted the superiority of Western knowledge and the English language. His influence led to the English Education Act of 1835, which made English the medium of instruction for higher education and ceased support for Oriental institutions. Finally, Wood's Despatch in 1854 further solidified European learning, emphasizing its practical and economic benefits, such as promoting trade and creating demand for British goods, leading to the establishment of education departments and universities."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.1.4", "6.7.9", "8.7.1", "7.5.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today. Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the European companies within these new cities. The \u201cblacks\u201d or native traders and craftspersons were confined here while the \u201cwhite\u201d rulers occupied the superior residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St. William in Calcutta.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were at least three different kinds of people living in most villages in the southern and northern parts of the subcontinent. In the Tamil region, large landowners were known as vellalar, ordinary ploughmen were known as uzhavar, and landless labourers, including slaves, were known as kadaisiyar and adimai. \nIn the northern part of the country, the village headman was known as the grama bhojaka. Usually, men from the same family held the position for generations. In other words, the post was hereditary. The grama bhojaka was often the largest landowner. Generally, he had slaves and hired workers to cultivate the land. Besides, as he was powerful, the king often used him to collect taxes from the village. He also functioned as a judge, and sometimes as a policeman. \nApart from the gramabhojaka, there were other independent farmers, known as grihapatis, most of whom were smaller landowners. And then there were men and women such as the dasa karmakara, who did not own land, and had to earn a living working on the fields owned by others. \nIn most villages there were also some crafts persons such as the blacksmith, potter, carpenter and weaver. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did various groups and individuals, including tribal people, samantas, and those with administrative or local influence, contribute to the evolution of political power and administrative structures in the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The texts provide multiple examples of how power dynamics evolved. \n2. Section 1 states that some tribal people established extensive states with well-organised administration, becoming politically powerful and entering into conflict with larger kingdoms. This shows a direct contribution to the formation of new political entities.\n3. Section 2 describes the rise of 'samantas' (landlords/warrior chiefs) who, initially subordinates, gained power and wealth, eventually declaring independence and establishing their own authority, sometimes even overthrowing their overlords (e.g., the Rashtrakutas). It also mentions men from enterprising families, like the Brahmanas Kadamba Mayurasharman and Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra, who used military skills to carve out kingdoms, demonstrating another path to political power.\n4. Section 4 highlights changes in administration where important posts became hereditary (e.g., Harishena as maha-danda-nayaka like his father) and individuals often held multiple offices. Furthermore, influential local figures such as the nagarashreshthi (chief banker), sarthavaha (leader of merchant caravans), prathama-kulika (chief craftsman), and head of the kayasthas (scribes) gained a say in local administration, with some growing powerful enough to set up independent kingdoms.\n5. Section 3 illustrates village-level power through the 'grama bhojaka' in northern India. This hereditary village headman was often the largest landowner, collected taxes for the king, and acted as a judge and policeman, thereby holding significant administrative and political authority at the local level.\n6. These examples collectively demonstrate how different groups and individuals contributed to the dynamic evolution of political power and administrative structures, from the formation of independent states to the exercise of authority within villages.\n\nAnswer: Various groups and individuals significantly shaped the evolving political and administrative structures. Some tribal people established extensive states with well-organised administrations, becoming politically powerful and clashing with larger kingdoms. Samantas, initially subordinates, accumulated wealth and power, asserting independence from their overlords and sometimes founding new kingdoms, as did enterprising individuals like the Brahmanas Kadamba Mayurasharman and Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra, who used military skills to create states. Administrative posts became hereditary, and influential local men, such as chief bankers, merchant leaders, chief craftsmen, and scribes, gained a say in local administration, with some eventually establishing independent kingdoms. At the village level, the grama bhojaka, a powerful and often hereditary headman, served as the largest landowner, tax collector, judge, and policeman, exerting considerable local administrative and political authority."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.7", "7.2.1", "6.9.3", "6.11.7", "6.2.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Bengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist monasteries) depict scenes of fish being dressed and taken to the market in baskets. \nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat nonvegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for the Bengal Brahmanas. The Brihaddharma Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the administrative measures taken by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq to address the challenges posed by the Mongol threat, highlighting the outcomes of their respective strategies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify the common challenge:** Both Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq faced the significant administrative challenge of maintaining a large standing army due to Mongol invasions or the threat thereof.

The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThis was also the time when Aryabhata, a mathematician and astronomer, wrote a book in Sanskrit known as the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis, even though it seems as if the sun is rising and setting everyday.

These six systems of philosophy are said to have been founded by sages Konada, Gotama, Kapila, Patanjali, Jaimini and Vyasa, respectively. These philosophies still guide scholarly discourse in the country.

Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago.

The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen that the earliest people hunted, gathered plant produce, made stone tools, and painted on cave walls. Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLarge states like those of the Cholas (Chapter 2), Tughluqs (Chapter 3) or Mughals (Chapter 4) encompassed many regions. A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that are similar and circle those that are different. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nNomadic pastoralists moved over long distances with their animals. They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were some of the key interactions and impacts of the Mughal Empire on different groups and regions within the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

Let us see how they study the Rigveda. \nSome of the hymns in the Rigveda are in the form of dialogues. This is part of one such hymn, a dialogue between a sage named Vishvamitra, and two rivers, (Beas and Sutlej) that were worshipped as goddesses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nVery often, a single town was important for a variety of reasons. Let us look at the example of Mathura (Map 7, page 113). \nMathura has been an important settlement for more than 2500 years. It was important because it was located at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south. There were fortifications around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food for people in the city. Mathura was also a centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced. \nAround 2000 years ago Mathura became the second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you will be reading in Chapter 10. Mathura was also a religious centre \u2014 there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and it was an important centre for the worship of Krishna.ks \nmoSeveral inscriptions on surfaces such as stone slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to monasteries and shrines. These were made by kings and queens, officers, merchants, and crafts persons who lived in the city. For instance, inscriptions from Mathura mention goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers.ks \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe lions that we see on our notes and coins have a long history. They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary reasons for the importance of cities within Ashoka's empire like Taxila and Ujjain, and how did Mathura's significance compare? Additionally, what evidence of specialized crafts and professions is mentioned for cities in Ashoka's empire, Mathura, and Harappan cities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought begins by identifying the reasons for the importance of cities in Ashoka's empire. The first text states that Taxila was a 'gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia,' and Ujjain 'lay on the route from north to south India,' indicating their strategic locations for trade and travel. For Ashoka's empire cities, the text also mentions 'Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities.'\n\nNext, the focus shifts to Mathura. The second text explains Mathura's diverse importance: it was an 'important settlement for more than 2500 years' due to its location 'at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south.' It also had 'fortifications,' 'several shrines,' was a 'centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced,' became the 'second capital of the Kushanas,' and was a 'religious centre' with Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and a center for Krishna worship. Inscriptions from Mathura specifically mention 'goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers' as professions.\n\nFinally, for Harappan cities, the fourth text details various crafts. Objects found include tools, weapons, ornaments, and vessels made of copper, bronze, gold, and silver. Other striking finds were 'beads, weights, and blades.' Harappans also made 'seals out of stone' with animal carvings and 'pots with beautiful black designs.' The text explicitly states that 'Cotton was probably grown' and 'actual pieces of cloth were found,' along with 'spindle whorls' used to spin thread. It highlights the presence of 'specialists' trained for 'cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals,' indicating a range of specialized crafts.\n\nAnswer: Cities like Taxila and Ujjain within Ashoka's empire were important primarily due to their strategic geographical locations; Taxila served as a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain was situated on a major route from north to south India. In contrast, Mathura's significance was multifaceted and long-standing, being important for over 2500 years due to its location at the crossroads of two major trade routes (northwest to east and north to south), its fortifications, numerous shrines, production of fine sculpture, its role as the second capital of the Kushanas, and its status as a religious center for Buddhist, Jaina, and Krishna worship.\n\nRegarding specialized crafts and professions:\n-   **Ashoka's empire cities:** Merchants, officials, and general crafts persons are mentioned as residents.\n-   **Mathura:** Inscriptions record gifts made by specific professionals such as goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, and perfumers, in addition to sculptors implied by the production of fine sculpture.\n-   **Harappan cities:** Evidence suggests specialized craft production including tools, weapons, ornaments, and vessels from stone, shell, copper, bronze, gold, and silver. Other crafts include the making of beads, weights, blades, stone seals with animal carvings, pottery with black designs, and textiles (cotton, cloth, and spindle whorls for spinning thread), with explicit mention of 'specialists' for tasks like cutting stone, polishing beads, or carving seals."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.1", "6.9.7", "7.2.1", "6.4.5", "6.5.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the methods used by the Muvendar to acquire wealth, and which two of their power centers were considered most important?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that the Muvendar, identified as the 'three chiefs,' did not collect regular taxes.

Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe thousand years of history that we are exploring witnessed major developments in religious traditions. People\u2019s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective belief in a supernatural agency \u2013 religion \u2013 was often closely connected with the social and economic organisation of local communities. As the social worlds of these groups altered so too did their beliefs. \nIt was during this period that important changes occurred in what we call Hinduism today. These included the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty and the growing importance of Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society. Their knowledge of Sanskrit texts earned the Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant position was consolidated by the support of their patrons \u2013 new rulers searching for prestige. \nOne of the major developments of this period was the emergence of the idea of bhakti \u2013 of a loving, personal deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about this, and other traditions, in Chapter 8. \nThis was also the period when new religions appeared in the subcontinent. Merchants and migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the Quran as their holy book and accept the sovereignty of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard to social background. \nMany rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama \u2013 learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism, Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its followers. There were the Shia Muslims who believed that the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s son-in-law, Ali, was the legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and the Sunni Muslims who accepted the authority of the early leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and the succeeding Khalifas. There were other important differences between the various schools of law (Hanafi and Shafi\u2019i mainly in India), and in theology and mystic traditions. \nPatron - An influential, wealthy individual who supports another person \u2013 an artiste, a craftsperson, a learned man, or a noble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou may have noticed how wealth is measured in terms of coins in the story on page 90. Archaeologists have found several thousands of coins belonging to this period. The earliest coins which were in use for about 500 years were punch marked coins, \nPunch-marked coins were generally rectangular or sometimes square or round in shape, either cut out of metal sheets or made out of flattened metal globules (a small spherical body). The coins were not inscribed, but were stamped with symbols using dies or punches. Hence, they are called punch-marked coins. These coins are found over most parts of the subcontinent and remained in circulation till the early centuries CE. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did colonial policies, new religious developments, and economic systems lead to significant changes in the lives of people and the organization of societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Colonial Policies (Text 1):** The first text details how British colonial rule profoundly changed tribal lives. Tribal chiefs lost administrative power, were forced to follow British laws, pay tribute, and discipline their people on behalf of the British. Shifting cultivators were pressured to settle, and new forest laws restricted their traditional practices, forcing many to migrate or provide labor to the Forest Department under exploitative conditions. This fundamentally altered their traditional governance, livelihoods, and freedom.\n2.  **New Religious Developments (Text 2):** The second text describes major developments in religious traditions over a thousand years. Hinduism saw changes like the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty, and the growing importance of Brahmanas. The emergence of Bhakti offered a more personal path to the divine. The arrival of Islam in the seventh century introduced new beliefs and practices, leading to diverse interpretations (Shia and Sunni) and influencing rulers and societal structures.\n3.  **Economic Systems (Text 1 & 3):** The third text introduces punch-marked coins as an early economic mechanism for measuring wealth, indicating the existence of structured economic systems over centuries. The first text further illustrates how colonial economic systems and practices severely impacted tribal communities. Traders and moneylenders exploited tribal silk growers, paying them meager wages for cocoons sold at much higher prices. Furthermore, tribals were recruited for tea plantations and coal mines under contractors, receiving miserably low wages and being prevented from returning home, which signifies a highly exploitative economic system changing their traditional economic independence.\n\nAnswer: Colonial policies, as seen under British rule, significantly altered tribal governance by reducing chiefs' powers, restricted traditional livelihoods like shifting cultivation through forest laws, and led to severe economic exploitation in trade and labor. New religious developments over a thousand years transformed Hinduism with new deities, temples, and the rise of Brahmanas, alongside the emergence of Bhakti and the introduction of Islam, which brought new beliefs and societal interpretations. Economic systems, exemplified by early currency like punch-marked coins and later by colonial-era exploitative trade and labor practices, fundamentally reshaped how wealth was measured and how communities, particularly tribal groups, sustained their livelihoods and interacted with external markets."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.3", "7.1.6", "6.9.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Kabir's teachings critique the social structure and the role of the priestly class as described for the later Vedic period?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that Kabir\u2019s teachings \"openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system.\" The second text section describes the social structure of the later Vedic period, where \"The priests divided people into four groups, called varnas,\" with the 'brahmin' being the first varna, expected to \"study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts.\" This section also notes that the varna system was based on birth and that 'shudras' and women were not allowed to study the Vedas or perform rituals, and that \"Many people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins\" and condemned untouchability. By rejecting the 'pre-eminence of the priestly classes,' Kabir directly challenged the elevated status and exclusive rights of the brahmins described in the later Vedic period. His rejection of the 'caste system' directly opposed the varna system's hierarchical divisions and restrictions based on birth. Furthermore, Kabir's belief in a 'formless Supreme God' and 'bhakti or devotion' as the 'only path to salvation' contrasted with the ritualistic practices and emphasis on sacrifices performed by the priests in the Vedic tradition.\n\nAnswer: Kabir's teachings critiqued the later Vedic social structure by openly ridiculing the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. This directly challenged the brahmins' top position and exclusive ritualistic roles within the varna system, which divided people by birth and restricted access to knowledge and rituals for groups like shudras and women. Kabir advocated for devotion to a formless Supreme God as the sole path to salvation, contrasting with the ritual-centric practices described for the Vedic priests."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.8.10", "6.6.2", "7.5.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.

One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nYou may have seen people perform rituals of worship, or singing bhajans, kirtans or qawwalis, or even repeating the name of God in silence, and noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations. They were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made.

It states that historians use 'official records of the British administration', including 'memos, notings and reports' preserved in 'record rooms', 'archives and museums'. It also mentions various 'surveys' like revenue, census, botanical, zoological, archaeological, anthropological, and forest surveys. For understanding perspectives beyond official records, it lists 'diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets', as well as 'newspapers', and writings by 'leaders and reformers, poets and novelists'.\n\nThe fourth text section, describing kingdoms after the Mauryan empire, provides sources for an earlier period. It explicitly states, 'We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.'\n\nBy combining information from these two sections, we can identify diverse sources across different historical periods mentioned in the texts.\n\nAnswer: Historians utilize a variety of sources to understand Indian history. For the last 250 years, these include official records of the British administration (such as memos, reports, and preserved documents in record rooms, archives, and museums), and various surveys (like revenue, census, botanical, zoological, archaeological, anthropological, and forest surveys). Additionally, non-official sources like diaries, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies, popular booklets, newspapers, and the writings of leaders, reformers, poets, and novelists are used.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nUsually two to three generations live together in small settlements or villages. Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together.

The second section, 'Through the Eyes of the People,' details these reasons through two sources. Vishnubhatt Godse's account (Source 1) states that sepoys believed the English intended to wipe out the religions of Hindus and Muslims by introducing eighty-four rules, which kings rejected, leading to a planned 'war of religion.' Subedar Sitaram Pande's memoirs (Source 2) add that the seizing of Oudh created distrust among sepoys. Additionally, agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi incited soldiers to mutiny with promises of restoring the Emperor of Delhi. A crucial factor was the report that new rifle cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, which was seen as an attempt to defile both Mahommedans and Hindus, fueling the belief that the English aimed to convert them to Christianity. These elements collectively contributed to the widespread excitement and planning for the uprising.\n\nAnswer: The anticipated 'massive upheaval' against British rule was primarily attributed to the English's perceived determination to wipe out Hindu and Muslim religions through eighty-four rules, the distrust among sepoys caused by the seizing of Oudh, incitement by agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi to restore the Emperor of Delhi, and the belief that new rifle cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, intended to defile religious groups and facilitate conversion to Christianity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.8", "8.5.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe lions that we see on our notes and coins have a long history. They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIndian Textiles and the World Market \n\n Let us first look at textile production. Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nTake a look at Table 1 once again. You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains. But it was difficult to keep this balance all the time. Look at Table 1 again \u2013 note that Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji when he came to accept Mughal authority. What was the consequence of this insult? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal fundamentally alter its trade financing and subsequently contribute to the decline of the traditional Indian textile industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that prior to gaining the Diwani, the East India Company (EIC) faced a significant challenge in financing its trade with India, as it had to import \"gold and silver imported from Britain\" to purchase goods, since \"Britain had no goods to sell in India.\" This situation changed dramatically in 1785 when the \"Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal.\" The Diwani granted the EIC the right to \"use the vast revenue resources of Bengal,\" which solved its major financing problem. The text explicitly states that \"The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.\" \n\nThis shift in financing, while initially allowing the EIC to continue purchasing Indian textiles, was part of a broader context that contributed to the decline of the Indian textile industry. The text highlights that the \"development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways.\" Specifically, \"Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets,\" and \"exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain.\" By the early nineteenth century, \"Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets,\" leading to \"Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment.\" The EIC's agents also \"stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies.\" Thus, the Diwani enabled the EIC to sustain its trade and administrative costs in India without relying on British bullion, simultaneously creating a political and economic environment where British industrial goods, protected by high duties and supported by the Company's power, could outcompete and displace traditional Indian textiles.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company's acquisition of the Diwani of Bengal in 1785 fundamentally altered its trade financing by allowing it to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal to fund its expenses and purchase Indian goods, thereby eliminating the need to import gold and silver from Britain. This shift, combined with the rise of British cotton industries, contributed to the decline of the traditional Indian textile industry as Indian textiles faced competition from cheaper British goods in global markets, high duties when exported to Britain, and reduced demand from the Company, leading to widespread unemployment among Indian weavers."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.1", "7.4.5", "8.2.2", "8.6.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

These were carefully arranged by people, and were used to mark burial sites. The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. \nSome important megalithic sites are shown on Map 2 (page14). While some megaliths can be seen on the surface, other megalithic burials are often underground. \nSometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground. These are the only indications that there are burials beneath. \nThere were several things that people did to make megaliths. We have made a list here. Try and arrange them in the correct order: digging pits in the earth, transporting stones, breaking boulders, placing stones in position, finding suitable stone, shaping stones, burying the dead. \nAll these burials have some common features. Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. Also found are tools and weapons of iron and sometimes, skeletons of horses, horse equipment and ornaments of stone and gold. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the nineteenth century, the region that constitutes most of present-day Rajasthan, was called Rajputana by the British. While this may suggest that this was an area that was inhabited only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. There were (and are) several groups who identify themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and central India. And of course, there are several peoples other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan. \nThese cultural traditions were closely linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. From about the eighth century, most of the present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) was one such ruler. These rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow their example. Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories \u2013 which often depicted dramatic situations, and a range of strong emotions \u2013 loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger, etc. \nDid women find a place within these stories? Sometimes, they figure as the \u201ccause\u201d for conflicts, as men fought with one another to either \u201cwin\u201d or \u201cprotect\u201d women. Women are also depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death \u2013 there are stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay for it with their lives. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou read about the Northern Black Polished Ware in Chapter 9. This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these long journeys. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nMost prashastis also mention the ancestors of the ruler. This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full of learned people, including Kalidasa the poet, and Aryabhata the astronomer, about whom you will read more in Chapter 12. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What are the distinct characteristics and contexts of the two types of pottery mentioned in the provided texts, specifically Black and Red Ware and Northern Black Polished Ware?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that \"Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware,\" placing this pottery type in the context of megalithic burial sites.

From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars. \nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble\u2019s position in court and the larger his salary. \nNobles with a zat of 5,000 were ranked higher than those of 1,000. In Akbar\u2019s reign there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars had increased to 79. \nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary. \nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country. \nIn Akbar\u2019s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb\u2019s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What issues arose within the mansabdar and jagir system during Aurangzeb's reign, and what were the consequences of these developments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that mansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs.

A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers.

There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe have seen in Chapter 2 that the climate of the world was changing, and so were plants and animals that people used as food. Men, women and children probably observed several things: the places where edible plants were found, how seeds broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. Perhaps they began looking after plants \u2014 protecting them from birds and animals so that they could grow and the seeds could ripen. In this way people became farmers. \nWomen, men and children could also attract and then tame animals by leaving food for them near their shelters. The first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that were relatively gentle to come near the camps where they lived. These animals such as sheep, goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and most of them ate grass. Often, people protected these animals from attacks by other wild animals. This is how they became herders. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found traces of huts or houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, which were dug into the ground, with steps leading into them. These may have provided shelter in cold weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking hearths both inside and outside the huts, which suggests that, depending on the weather, people could cook food either indoors or outdoors. \nStone tools have been found from many sites as well. Many of these are different from the earlier Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles used for grinding grain and other plant produce. Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain even today, several thousand years later. At the same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued to be made and used, and remember, some tools were also made of bone. \nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been found. These were sometimes decorated, and were used for storing things. People began using pots for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat and lentils that now became an important part of the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using different kinds of materials, for example cotton, that could now be grown. \nDid things change everywhere and all at once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women still continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere people adopted farming and herding slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, in some cases people tried to combine these activities, doing different things during different seasons.imals \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what types of valuable materials did Egyptian kings and Harappan rulers send people to distant lands to acquire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMost of Egypt is a dry desert, except for the lands along the river Nile \nAround 5000 years ago, kings ruled over Egypt.

Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally, fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river. In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors contributed to the transformation of the struggle against British rule into a mass movement after 1919, and how did various social groups interpret and participate in the Non-Cooperation Movement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question asks about the factors contributing to the growth of mass nationalism after 1919. The text states, 'After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement... Why was this so?' It then lists several reasons: The First World War altered the economic and political situation in India, leading to a huge rise in defence expenditure, increased taxes on incomes and business profits, and a sharp rise in prices. Conversely, business groups reaped profits, and Indian industries expanded, leading them to demand greater opportunities. The war also led the British to expand their army, pressuring villages to supply soldiers, many of whom returned with anti-colonial views. Furthermore, the 1917 Russian Revolution, with its news of peasant and worker struggles and socialist ideas, inspired Indian nationalists. Finally, the advent of Mahatma Gandhi, who arrived in 1915 from South Africa as an already respected leader, and his subsequent travels and interventions in local movements, played a crucial role in his emergence as a mass leader.\n\nThe second part of the question asks how various social groups interpreted and participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement. The text describes the movement's momentum through 1921-22, noting that thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges, many lawyers gave up their practices, British titles were surrendered, legislatures boycotted, and people lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. Beyond these general actions, specific interpretations and participations are mentioned:\n*   In Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organized non-violent campaigns against high land revenue demands.\n*   In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed.\n*   In Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged 'forest satyagrahas,' protesting restricted forest resource use by sending cattle into forests without paying grazing fees. They believed Gandhiji would reduce their taxes and abolish forest regulations, proclaiming 'swaraj' and 'Gandhi Raj.'\n*   In Sind and Bengal, Muslim traders and peasants were enthusiastic about the Khilafat call, and the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance fostered communal unity and strength.\n*   In Punjab, the Akali agitation, seeking to remove corrupt mahants from gurdwaras, closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement.\n*   In Assam, tea garden labourers demanded wage increases, left plantations shouting 'Gandhi Maharaj ki Jai,' believing they were following Gandhiji's wish, and even substituted 'Krishna' with 'Gandhi Raja' in local Vaishnava songs.\n*   In Pratapgarh, United Provinces, peasants managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants, crediting Gandhiji with this achievement, even though their actions sometimes did not conform to Gandhian ideals.\n\nAnswer: The struggle against British rule transformed into a mass movement after 1919 due to several factors: the economic and political changes brought about by the First World War, including increased taxes and prices, expansion of Indian industries, and soldiers returning with anti-colonial sentiments; the inspiration from the 1917 Russian Revolution's ideas of peasant and worker struggles; and the emergence of Mahatma Gandhi as a mass leader following his return from South Africa in 1915. During the Non-Cooperation Movement, various social groups participated and interpreted Gandhi's call in their own ways. This included students leaving government institutions, lawyers giving up practices, and boycotts of British titles, legislatures, and foreign cloth. More specifically:\n*   Patidar peasants in Kheda organized non-violent campaigns against high land revenue.\n*   Liquor shops were picketed in coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu.\n*   Tribals and poor peasants in Guntur staged 'forest satyagrahas' against restricted forest resources, believing 'Gandhi Raj' would bring tax reductions and abolished regulations.\n*   Muslim traders and peasants in Sind and Bengal enthusiastically supported the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance, strengthening communal unity.\n*   The Akali agitation in Punjab, aimed at removing corrupt mahants, identified with the movement.\n*   Tea garden labourers in Assam demanded wage increases and left plantations, shouting 'Gandhi Maharaj ki Jai' and associating 'Gandhi Raja' with their aspirations.\n*   Peasants in Pratapgarh stopped illegal evictions, crediting Gandhiji with their success."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.10", "8.9.2", "6.4.11", "6.2.1", "6.4.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAround the time when Jainism and Buddhism were becoming popular, brahmins developed the system of ashramas. Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study \n Much before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at a place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country. \nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of Odisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and 1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no inclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Odisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817. \nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures. It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of shortterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case of natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal. \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these grievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of making salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape. \nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took away a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions with Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started. The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The priests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support. \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha. Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi jagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed, many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by May 1817 the uprising was mostly contained. \nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May 1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and forbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary reforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \n In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had far reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To merely call it a \u2018Paik Rebellion\u2019 will thus be an understatement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWhile many people lived in the cities, others living in the countryside grew crops and reared animals. These farmers and herders supplied food to crafts persons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We know from remains of plants that the Harappans grew wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed and mustard. \nA new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds. While real ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have not survived, toy models have been found. As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used. This means that water was stored and supplied to the fields when the plants were growing. \nThe Harappans reared cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available around settlements. However, in the dry summer months large herds of animals were probably taken to greater distances in search of grass and water. They also collected fruits like ber, caught fish and hunted wild animals like the antelope. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did agricultural practices and related technologies differ between the Harappan civilization and the period between 700 and 1750 CE, based on the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text describes Harappan agricultural practices, stating they grew crops like wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed, and mustard. They used a 'plough' for digging and planting, and 'some form of irrigation' was likely used to store and supply water due to low rainfall. The second text, covering the period between 700 and 1750 CE, mentions a 'gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture'. It highlights the appearance of 'new technologies' such as the 'Persian wheel in irrigation' and the arrival of 'new foods and beverages' like potatoes, corn, and chillies. Therefore, a key difference in technology is the specific mention of the Persian wheel for irrigation in the later period, compared to a more general 'some form of irrigation' and the plough in the Harappan era. Additionally, the range of crops expanded significantly in the later period with the introduction of new food items.\n\nAnswer: During the Harappan civilization, farmers grew crops such as wheat, barley, and pulses, utilizing a plough and likely some form of irrigation. In contrast, the period between 700 and 1750 CE saw an extension of agriculture through forest clearing, the introduction of advanced technologies like the Persian wheel for irrigation, and the arrival of new crops and foods such as potatoes, corn, and chillies."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.7", "7.1.4", "8.5.6", "6.7.9"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the key features of the Permanent Settlement, Mahalwari Settlement, and Ryotwari (Munro) system, and highlight the main problems encountered with each by the East India Company."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes three distinct revenue systems implemented by the East India Company. \n\n1.  **Permanent Settlement (1793):**\n    *   **Features:** Introduced in 1793, it recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars. They were tasked with collecting rent from peasants and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. The aim was to ensure a regular revenue flow and encourage zamindars to invest in land improvement.\n    *   **Problems:** Company officials found zamindars were not investing in land improvement. The fixed revenue was initially too high, leading many zamindaris to be sold off. Later, as market prices rose and cultivation expanded, zamindars' income increased, but the Company gained nothing due to the fixed revenue. Cultivators found the system oppressive with high rents, insecure land rights, and frequent evictions.\n\n2.  **Mahalwari Settlement (1822):**\n    *   **Features:** Devised by Holt Mackenzie in 1822 for the North Western Provinces. It focused on the 'mahal' (village or group of villages) as the revenue unit. Collectors inspected land, measured fields, and recorded customs, with the estimated revenue of each plot added up for the entire mahal. This demand was to be revised periodically, not fixed permanently. The village headman, rather than the zamindar, was responsible for collecting and paying the revenue.\n    *   **Problems:** The text does not explicitly detail unique problems for the Mahalwari system alone but notes a general problem with 'new systems' (which would include Mahalwari and Ryotwari) where revenue officials fixed too high a demand, leading to peasants being unable to pay, ryots fleeing, and villages becoming deserted.\n\n3.  **Ryotwari (Munro) System:**\n    *   **Features:** Developed by Thomas Munro (and initially tried by Captain Alexander Read) in the southern British territories, where there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement was made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields were carefully and separately surveyed before revenue assessment.\n    *   **Problems:** Similar to the general issues with the new systems, revenue officials fixed excessively high demands to increase income. This resulted in peasants being unable to pay, ryots deserting the countryside, and villages becoming deserted in many regions.\n\nAnswer: The Permanent Settlement (1793) recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars, fixing revenue permanently, but led to zamindars not investing in land and cultivators facing high rents and evictions. The Mahalwari Settlement (1822) in the North Western Provinces made the village (mahal) the unit, with periodically revised revenue collected by the village headman. The Ryotwari (Munro) system, prevalent in the south, settled directly with cultivators (ryots) after surveying their fields. A common problem across the Mahalwari and Ryotwari systems was that revenue officials fixed excessively high demands, causing peasants to flee and villages to become deserted."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwara. \nBefore his death in 1539, Baba Guru Nanak appointed one of his followers as his successor. His name was Lehna but he came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that he was a part of Baba Guru Nanak himself. Guru Angad compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur\u2019s son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as \u2018a state within the state\u2019. The Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement. The ideas of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this development from the very beginning. He emphasised the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications. This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons. The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, how did the Delhi Sultanate consolidate its control and expand its territory, and what factors contributed to the early Sikh community's rise as a distinct, self-governing entity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for two distinct parts: the Delhi Sultanate's consolidation and expansion, and the factors for the Sikh community's rise as a self-governing entity. I will extract information for each part directly from the respective text sections.\n\n**For the Delhi Sultanate's consolidation and expansion:**\n1.  **Initial State:** The text states that in the early thirteenth century, control was limited to heavily fortified towns, and the Sultans depended on trade, tribute, or plunder for supplies, with distant control being difficult due to communication issues, rebellion, and Mongol invasions (Section 1, paragraph 1).\n2.  **Consolidation:** This occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban (Section 1, paragraph 1).\n3.  **Expansion:** Further expansion happened under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq (Section 1, paragraph 1).\n4.  **'Internal Frontier' Campaigns:** These aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of garrison towns. Methods included clearing forests in the Ganga-Yamuna doab, expelling hunter-gatherers and pastoralists, encouraging agriculture by giving land to peasants, and establishing new fortresses, garrison towns, and towns to protect trade routes and promote regional trade (Section 1, paragraph 2).\n5.  **'External Frontier' Expansion:** This involved military expeditions into southern India, starting with Alauddin Khalji and culminating with Muhammad Tughluq. These campaigns resulted in the capture of elephants, horses, slaves, and precious metals (Section 1, paragraph 3).\n6.  **Administrative Measures:** By Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, the Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice (Section 1, paragraph 4).\n7.  **Symbolic Presence:** The Delhi Sultans built mosques across the subcontinent to demonstrate their claims as protectors of Islam and Muslims, and to foster a sense of community among diverse believers (Section 1, paragraph 5).\n\n**For the early Sikh community's rise as a distinct, self-governing entity:**\n1.  **Foundational Practices:** Baba Guru Nanak established a center at Kartarpur where followers, irrespective of creed, caste, or gender, ate together in a common kitchen (langar) and engaged in regular worship of his hymns, creating a sacred space known as dharmsal (now Gurdwara) (Section 2, paragraph 1).\n2.  **Spiritual Unification:** The compilation of Baba Guru Nanak's compositions by Guru Angad (who added his own in Gurmukhi) and subsequent Gurus, culminating in Guru Arjan's compilation in 1604 (which became the Guru Granth Sahib, authenticated by Guru Gobind Singh in 1706), provided a unified scripture and doctrinal basis (Section 2, paragraph 2).\n3.  **Emergence of a Center:** By the early seventeenth century, Ramdaspur (Amritsar) developed around Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple) and became virtually self-governing. This led modern historians to describe the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as 'a state within the state' (Section 2, paragraph 3).\n4.  **Mughal Persecution:** Mughal emperor Jahangir viewed them as a threat and ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606, which likely solidified their resolve and distinct identity (Section 2, paragraph 3).\n5.  **Politicisation:** The Sikh movement became politicised in the seventeenth century, culminating in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699, transforming the community (Khalsa Panth) into a political entity (Section 2, paragraph 3).\n6.  **Guru Nanak's Teachings:** His emphasis on the worship of one God, the irrelevance of caste, creed, or gender for liberation, and the pursuit of an active life with a strong sense of social commitment (right worship, welfare of others, purity of conduct; honest living, helping others) fostered a strong sense of equality, community, and social responsibility, which had significant social and political implications (Section 2, paragraph 4).\n\nAnswer: The Delhi Sultanate consolidated its control and expanded its territory through a combination of internal and external campaigns. Internally, they cleared forests, encouraged agriculture in the hinterlands, and established new fortresses and towns to protect trade routes. Externally, they conducted military expeditions into southern India, capturing resources. They also collected taxes, dispensed justice, and built mosques to demonstrate their authority and foster a sense of community.\n\nThe early Sikh community rose as a distinct, self-governing entity due to several factors: the establishment of communal practices like the langar and shared worship by Baba Guru Nanak, the compilation and authentication of their holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) by his successors, the development of a self-governing center at Ramdaspur (Amritsar) around the Harmandar Sahib, persecution by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, and the eventual politicisation of the movement culminating in the institution of the Khalsa. These developments were profoundly influenced by Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s teachings emphasizing the importance of one God, equality across caste, creed, and gender, and an active life with strong social commitment."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.3.3", "7.8.11"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Some of these are preserved in collections of stories such as the Jatakas and the Panchatantra, which were written down around this time. Stories from the Jatakas were often shown on the railings of stupas and in paintings in places such as Ajanta. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare the administrative and military strategies employed by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq to manage their large armies and address the threat of Mongol invasions, highlighting the outcomes of their respective approaches."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text provides a direct comparison of Alauddin Khalji's and Muhammad Tughluq's strategies against Mongol invasions and for maintaining a large army. \n\n1.  **Garrison Town/Housing:** Alauddin Khalji constructed a new garrison town called Siri for his soldiers. In contrast, Muhammad Tughluq emptied the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) of its residents to garrison his soldiers, relocating the residents to Daulatabad.\n\n2.  **Feeding the Army/Taxation:** Both sultans fed their armies through taxes collected from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Alauddin Khalji fixed this tax at 50 percent of the peasant's yield. Muhammad Tughluq, however, levied *additional* taxes for maintaining his large army, which coincided with a famine in the area.\n\n3.  **Paying Soldiers:** Both paid their soldiers cash salaries.\n\n4.  **Controlling Prices/Currency:** Alauddin Khalji controlled the prices of goods in Delhi to prevent inflation, with officers surveying prices and punishing non-compliant merchants.

Muhammad Tughluq's strategies were largely a failure, leading to widespread resentment, rebellion, and the recall of the token currency."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.1", "6.12.8", "7.3.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The potter used to expose the earthenware to very high temperature in his kiln which resulted in the blackening of its outer surface. A fine black slip was also applied on this, which gave the pottery a mirror-like shine \nFind Arikamedu (in Puducherry) on Map 7 (page 113), and read the box on Rome on page 96. Between 2200 and 1900 years ago, Arikamedu was a coastal settlement where ships unloaded goods from distant lands. A massive brick structure, which may have been a warehouse, was found at the site. Other finds include pottery from the Mediterranean region, such as amphorae (tall double-handled jars that contained liquids such as wine or oil) and stamped red-glazed pottery, known as Arretine Ware, which was named after a city in Italy. This was made by pressing wet clay into a stamped mould. There was yet another kind of pottery which was made locally, though Roman designs were used. Roman lamps, glassware and gems have also been found at the site. \nSmall tanks have been found that were probably dyeing vats, used to dye cloth. There is plenty of evidence for the making of beads from semi-precious stones and glass. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nArchaeologists have found traces of huts or houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, which were dug into the ground, with steps leading into them. These may have provided shelter in cold weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking hearths both inside and outside the huts, which suggests that, depending on the weather, people could cook food either indoors or outdoors. \nStone tools have been found from many sites as well. Many of these are different from the earlier Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles used for grinding grain and other plant produce. Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain even today, several thousand years later. At the same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued to be made and used, and remember, some tools were also made of bone. \nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been found. These were sometimes decorated, and were used for storing things. People began using pots for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat and lentils that now became an important part of the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using different kinds of materials, for example cotton, that could now be grown. \nDid things change everywhere and all at once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women still continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere people adopted farming and herding slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, in some cases people tried to combine these activities, doing different things during different seasons.imals \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere are several ways of finding out about the past. One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men and women (including kings and queens) recorded what they did. For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties? There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone, others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that are made of hard, imperishable substances usually survive for a long time. \nArchaeologists also look for bones \u2014 of animals, birds, and fish \u2014 to find out what people ate in the past. Plant remains survive far more rarely \u2014 if seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt, they survive in a charred form. Do you think cloth is found frequently by archaeologists? \nHistorians, that is, scholars who study the past, often use the word source to refer to the information found from manuscripts, inscriptions and archaeology. Once sources are found, learning about the past becomes an adventure, as we reconstruct it bit by bit. So historians and archaeologists are like detectives, who use all these sources like clues to find out about our pasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What types of pottery are mentioned in the provided texts, and what do their characteristics and uses reveal about the societies that produced or utilized them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need.

These included the significant time commitment required to cultivate plants (days, weeks, months, years), necessitating people to remain in one location to care for them (watering, weeding, driving away animals and birds). Furthermore, these societies faced the practical challenge of storing grain for both food and seed, leading to the development of storage solutions like large clay pots, woven baskets, or dug pits.\n\nThe second section shifts focus to the Maharashtra saint-poets from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries. Their concerns were primarily socio-spiritual. They rejected ritualism, outward displays of piety, and social differences based on birth. They emphasized a personal god, preferred living with families while serving others, and promoted a humanist idea that 'bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain.' The texts also highlight their confrontation with social inequality, particularly the caste system, as evidenced by Chokhamela\u2019s son's abhang questioning why he was made 'low caste.'\n\nTherefore, the distinct types of challenges were practical and survival-oriented for early agricultural societies, whereas for the saint-poets, they were socio-spiritual, focusing on ethical conduct, social justice, and spiritual fulfillment.\n\nAnswer: Early agricultural societies faced practical challenges related to the extensive time and effort required for cultivation and the necessity of developing effective methods for storing grain for food and future seeds. In contrast, the saint-poets of Maharashtra addressed socio-spiritual concerns, rejecting ritualism and social differences based on birth, promoting a humanist idea of sharing others\u2019 pain, and challenging caste inequality."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.4", "7.8.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nCrops for Europe \n\n The British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n10 India After Independence \n\n A New and Divided Nation \n\n When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges. As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nBABUR 1526-1530 : 1526 \u2013 defeated Ibrahim Lodi and his Afghan supporters at Panipat. 1527 \u2013 defeated Rana Sanga, Rajput rulers and allies at Khanua. 1528 \u2013 defeated the Rajputs at Chanderi; Established control over Agra and Delhi before his death. \nHUMAYUN 1530-1540, 1555-1556 : (1) Humayun divided his inheritance according to the will of his father. His brothers were each given a province. The ambitions of his brother Mirza Kamran weakened Humayun\u2019s cause against Afghan competitors. Sher Khan defeated Humayun at Chausa (1539) and Kanauj (1540), forcing him to flee to Iran. (2) In Iran Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah. He recaptured Delhi in 1555 but died the next year after an accident in this building. \nAKBAR 1556-1605 : Akbar was 13 years old when he became emperor. His reign can be divided into three periods. (1) 1556-1570 \u2013 Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed. Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan, rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir\u2019s wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful. \nShah Jahan 1627-1658 : Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632 Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan\u2019s sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra. \nAurangzeb 1658-1707 : (1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas. His death was followed by a succession conflict amongst his sons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary difficulties encountered by planters in expanding 'nij' cultivation, and what issues did the 'ryoti' system present for the cultivators?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes two main systems of indigo cultivation: 'nij' and 'ryoti'. \n\nFor 'nij' cultivation, the text states several problems: \n1.

Mobilizing labor was also challenging, as it was required during the peasants' busy rice cultivation season. Furthermore, the system demanded a vast number of ploughs and bullocks, posing significant investment and maintenance problems, with supplies often unavailable from peasants. Under the 'ryoti' system, cultivators were forced into contracts, committing them to grow indigo on at least 25% of their land. They received very low prices for their indigo, trapping them in an endless cycle of debt. Planters insisted on using the best soils for indigo, which peasants preferred for rice, and indigo cultivation rapidly exhausted the soil, preventing subsequent rice crops."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.4.3", "6.4.4", "6.12.3", "8.10.1", "8.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident.

A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi).

One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men and women (including kings and queens) recorded what they did. For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties? There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins.

This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce.

As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh.

Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. \nThere are two groups who are described in terms of their work \u2014 the priests, sometimes called brahmins, who performed various rituals, and the rajas. \nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be learning about later. They did not have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Generally, sons did not automatically succeed fathers as rajas. \nTwo words were used to describe the people or the community as a whole. One was the word jana, which we still use in Hindi and other languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 6. \nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name. So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and so on. \nSometimes, the people who composed the hymns described themselves as Aryas and called their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were women and men who were often captured in war. They were treated as the property of their owners, who could make them do whatever work they wanted. \nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of these. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSomewhat before the time of the Mauryan empire, about 2400 years ago, emperors in China began building the Great Wall. \nIt was meant to protect the northern frontier of the empire from pastoral people.

There are watch towers all along, at distances of about 100-200 m. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the primary methods of describing people in the Rigveda, and how did the Rigvedic rajas differ from later rulers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that people in the Rigveda were described in several ways: by the work they do (e.g., priests/brahmins and rajas), by words for the community as a whole (jana and vish), and by identifying themselves as Aryas and their opponents as Dasas or Dasyus based on sacrifices and language.

People said he had miraculous powers \u2013 he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve all their problems. \nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas \u2013 a tribal group that lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region \u2013 Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be in danger. \nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? Who were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter. You have read about tribal societies last year. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThanjavur is also an example of a temple town. Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop. Temples were often central to the economy and society. Rulers built temples to demonstrate their devotion to various deities. They also endowed temples with grants of land and money to carry out elaborate rituals, feed pilgrims and priests and celebrate festivals. Pilgrims who flocked to the temples also made donations. \nBronze is an alloy containing copper and tin. Bell metal contains a greater proportion of tin than other kinds of bronze. This produces a bell-like sound. Chola bronze statues (see Chapter 2) were made using the \u201clost wax\u201d technique. First, an image was made of wax. This was covered with clay and allowed to dry. Next it was heated, and a tiny hole was made in the clay cover. The molten wax was drained out through this hole. Then molten metal was poured into the clay mould through the hole. Once the metal cooled and solidified, the clay cover was carefully removed, and the image was cleaned and polished. \nTemple authorities used their wealth to finance trade and banking. Gradually a large number of priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc. settled near the temple to cater to its needs and those of the pilgrims. Thus grew temple towns. Towns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. \nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships. Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns. Ajmer (Rajasthan) was the capital of the Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later became the suba headquarters under the Mughals. It provides an excellent example of religious coexistence. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, the celebrated Sufi saint (see also Chapter 8) who settled there in the twelfth century, attracted devotees from all creeds. Near Ajmer is a lake, Pushkar, which has attracted pilgrims from ancient times. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were, however, other kinds of societies as well. Many societies in the subcontinent did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. Nor were they divided into numerous unequal classes. Such societies are often called tribes. \nMembers of each tribe were united by kinship bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. Most often they combined these activities to make full use of the natural resources of the area in which they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved from one place to another. A tribal group controlled land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst households according to its own rules. \nMany large tribes thrived in different parts of the subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, deserts and places difficult to reach. Sometimes they clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and preserved their separate culture. \nBut the caste-based and tribal societies also depended on each other for their diverse needs. This relationship, of conflict and dependence, gradually caused both societies to change. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the defining characteristics of tribal societies in the subcontinent, including their social structure, livelihoods, and their interaction with caste-based societies, according to the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for the defining characteristics of tribal societies based on the provided text.

Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What significant changes did British colonial rule impose on the administrative authority of tribal chiefs, the economic practices of shifting cultivators, and the broader livelihood and trade experiences of tribal groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details several fundamental changes imposed by British colonial rule on tribal lives. \n\n1.  **Tribal Chiefs:** Before British rule, chiefs held significant economic power and administrative rights, including controlling territories, having their own police, and deciding local rules. Under British rule, they 'lost much of their administrative power' and were 'forced to follow laws made by British officials.' They had to 'pay tribute to the British' and 'discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British,' thereby losing their authority among their people.\n\n2.  **Shifting Cultivators:** The British, seeking control and regular revenue, 'wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators' and 'introduced land settlements.' While settled plough cultivation proved difficult and led to suffering for jhum cultivators in dry areas, widespread protests eventually forced the British to 'allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest.'\n\n3.  **Forest Laws and Livelihood:** The British 'extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property.' In 'Reserved Forests,' tribals 'were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals,' forcing many to 'move to other areas in search of work.' To secure labor for timber, the British established 'forest villages' where tribals had to 'provide labour to the Forest Department.'\n\n4.  **Trade Experiences:** Tribal groups faced exploitation as 'traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often.' The example of silk growers shows they were paid 'Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons' while middlemen sold them for 'five times the price,' making 'huge profits.' This led many tribal groups to view 'the market and the traders as their main enemies.'\n\n5.  **Search for Work:** Tribals were recruited 'in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand' through contractors who 'paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home.'\n\nThese points collectively demonstrate a systematic erosion of tribal autonomy, traditional economic practices, access to resources, and increased exploitation.\n\nAnswer: British colonial rule drastically altered tribal lives by stripping tribal chiefs of most of their administrative powers, forcing them to pay tribute and enforce British laws. Shifting cultivators were pressured to settle and adopt plough cultivation through land settlements, although protests led to some concessions for traditional practices. Forest laws declared forests state property, restricting tribal access to resources and forcing many to relocate or provide forced labor in 'forest villages.' Furthermore, tribal groups faced severe economic exploitation from traders and moneylenders, receiving meager payments for their produce, and were recruited for exploitative labor in tea plantations and mines with extremely low wages and restricted movement."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, when railway lines were being laid down for the first time in the Punjab, engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in present-day Pakistan. To them, it seemed like a mound that was a rich source of ready made, high quality bricks. So they carried off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the city to build railway lines. Many buildings were completely destroyed. \nThen, about eighty years ago, archaeologists found the site, and realised that this was one of the oldest cities in the subcontinent. As this was the first city to be discovered, all other sites from where similar buildings (and other things) were found were described as Harappan. These cities developed about 4700 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFallow \u2013 A field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility. Sal \u2013 A tree. Mahua \u2013 A flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol. Bewar \u2013 A term used in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation. \nHow Did Tribal Groups Live? \n\n By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities. Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nCompany Rule Expands \n\n If we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor- General (1798-1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. \nTipu Sultan \u2013 The \u201cTiger of Mysore\u201d The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. \nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1781 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close relationship with the French in India, and modernised his army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious, arrogant and dangerous \u2013 rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1787-89, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \nWar with the Marathas \n From the late eighteenth century the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1781, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy \n It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, carried on the resistance. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book. \nIn the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab was annexed. \nThe Doctrine of Lapse \n The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1858. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1858, the Company also took over Awadh. This time the British had an added argument \u2013 they said they were \u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What methods did the East India Company employ to expand its control over Indian states between 1757 and 1857, and how did British officials perceive different tribal groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question asks about the East India Company's expansion methods. The text from 'Company Rule Expands' section details several strategies: Initially, they used 'political, economic and diplomatic methods'. Specific methods included appointing 'Residents' in Indian states to interfere in internal affairs, forcing 'subsidiary alliances' where rulers paid for Company protection and ceded territory if they failed, and direct military confrontation when interests were threatened, as seen in the wars against Mysore and the Marathas. Later, under Lord Hastings, the policy of 'paramountcy' asserted the Company's supreme authority, justifying annexations. Finally, Lord Dalhousie introduced the 'Doctrine of Lapse', which annexed kingdoms without a male heir, and Awadh was taken over on the grounds of 'misgovernment'. The second part of the question asks about British perception of tribal groups. The 'How Did Tribal Groups Live?' section states that 'British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised.'\n\nAnswer: Between 1757 and 1857, the East India Company expanded its control through a variety of political, economic, and diplomatic methods. These included appointing Residents to interfere in internal state affairs, imposing subsidiary alliances that disarmed Indian rulers and demanded payments for Company forces, and engaging in direct military confrontations (e.g., with Mysore and the Marathas). Later, they introduced policies like 'paramountcy' to assert supreme authority and the 'Doctrine of Lapse' to annex states without a male heir. They also annexed territories like Awadh on the pretext of 'misgovernment'. Regarding tribal groups, British officials considered settled cultivators like the Gonds and Santhals to be more 'civilised' than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators, viewing those living in forests as 'wild and savage' who needed to be settled and civilised."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.1", "8.4.2", "8.2.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe main source of income available to Mughal rulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the economic contributions and practices of the Banjaras, and contrast this with the economic objectives behind the British East India Company's educational policies as outlined in Wood's Despatch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first step is to identify the economic contributions and practices of the Banjaras from the initial text section. The text states that Banjaras were 'the most important tradernomads' whose caravan was called tanda. They transported grain for Sultan Alauddin Khalji to city markets and for Emperor Jahangir and the Mughal army during military campaigns, sometimes with 100,000 bullocks. Peter Mundy described them as carrying 'grains such as wheat and rice' on 14,000 oxen. They bought grain 'where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer,' and then reloaded their oxen with 'anything that can be profitably sold in other places,' indicating their role as merchants who facilitated trade and supply across regions.\n\nThe second step is to identify the economic objectives of the British East India Company's educational policies, specifically from Wood's Despatch, found in the 'British Education in India' section. Wood's Despatch of 1854 emphasized 'the practical benefits of a system of European learning.' Its economic uses were to enable Indians 'to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country.' Furthermore, it aimed to change Indians' 'tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe.'\n\nFinally, to contrast these, the Banjaras' practices involved direct participation in trade and transportation, acting as itinerant merchants who moved goods based on existing supply and demand to meet the needs of cities and armies. Their activities were about facilitating the movement and exchange of commodities within the existing economic structure. In contrast, the British East India Company's objectives, through Wood's Despatch, were not merely to facilitate existing trade but to fundamentally alter Indian education to instill European learning, specifically to expand British trade and commerce, develop resources for British benefit, and crucially, to manipulate Indian consumer tastes to create a market and demand for British manufactured goods.\n\nAnswer: The Banjaras were crucial trader-nomads who significantly contributed to the economy by transporting goods, primarily grain, over long distances. They supplied city markets for rulers like Alauddin Khalji and provisioned the Mughal army, carrying vast quantities of wheat and rice on their oxen. They operated as merchants, buying goods where they were cheap and selling them where prices were higher, effectively facilitating inter-regional trade and supply.\n\nIn contrast, the British East India Company's economic objectives, as articulated in Wood's Despatch of 1854, were to leverage European learning to expand trade and commerce and develop India's resources. A key aim was to influence Indian tastes and desires through education, thereby creating a demand for British manufactured goods and encouraging Indians to purchase items produced in Europe. While the Banjaras directly engaged in and facilitated existing trade, the British policy sought to reshape the economy and consumer culture to primarily benefit British industrial and commercial interests."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.4", "8.7.1", "7.4.7", "8.9.2", "7.4.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nConclusion \n\n Thus the East India Company was transformed from a trading company to a territorial colonial power. The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \nBy 1857 the Company came to exercise direct rule over about 83 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, how did new technologies influence both the East India Company's expansion and the societal developments in the Indian subcontinent between 700 and 1750?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that 'The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process' of the East India Company transforming into a colonial power. It further details that 'Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India.' For the period between 700 and 1750, the second text section mentions that 'new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat.' It also clarifies that these 'innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well.

The chain of thought thus connects specific technologies to their respective impacts in the two distinct periods mentioned.\n\nAnswer: New steam technology in the early nineteenth century aided the East India Company's expansion by reducing sea travel time to India from six-eight months to three weeks, which enabled more Britishers and their families to come to the country. In the period between 700 and 1750, new technologies like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat appeared. These innovations, along with new crops, arrived with people bringing new ideas, which resulted in significant economic, political, social, and cultural changes in the subcontinent."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.2.5", "7.1.4", "7.7.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop. Temples were often central to the economy and society. Rulers built temples to demonstrate their devotion to various deities. They also endowed temples with grants of land and money to carry out elaborate rituals, feed pilgrims and priests and celebrate festivals. Pilgrims who flocked to the temples also made donations. \nBronze is an alloy containing copper and tin. Bell metal contains a greater proportion of tin than other kinds of bronze. This produces a bell-like sound. Chola bronze statues (see Chapter 2) were made using the \u201clost wax\u201d technique. First, an image was made of wax. This was covered with clay and allowed to dry. Next it was heated, and a tiny hole was made in the clay cover. The molten wax was drained out through this hole. Then molten metal was poured into the clay mould through the hole. Once the metal cooled and solidified, the clay cover was carefully removed, and the image was cleaned and polished. \nTemple authorities used their wealth to finance trade and banking. Gradually a large number of priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc. settled near the temple to cater to its needs and those of the pilgrims. Thus grew temple towns. Towns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. \nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships. Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns. Ajmer (Rajasthan) was the capital of the Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later became the suba headquarters under the Mughals. It provides an excellent example of religious coexistence. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, the celebrated Sufi saint (see also Chapter 8) who settled there in the twelfth century, attracted devotees from all creeds. Near Ajmer is a lake, Pushkar, which has attracted pilgrims from ancient times. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently. The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMehrunnisa married the Emperor Jahangir in 1611 and received the title Nur Jahan. She remained extremely loyal and supportive to the monarch. As a mark of honour, Jahangir struck silver coins bearing his own titles on one side and on the other the inscription \u201cstruck in the name of the Queen Begum, Nur Jahan\u201d. The adjoining document is an order (farman) of Nur Jahan. The square seal states, \u201cCommand of her most Sublime and Elevated Majesty Nur Jahan Padshah Begum\u201d. The round seal states, \u201cby the sun of Shah Jahangir she became as brilliant as the moon; may Nur Jahan Padshah be the lady of the age\u201d. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHow did the Cholas rise to power? A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did the Mauryan and Chola empires approach local governance and the collection of resources, highlighting any differences in their administrative structures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought will first detail the Mauryan administrative approach to local governance and resource collection, then describe the Chola methods, and finally, synthesize these points to highlight the differences. \n\n1.  **Mauryan Empire's Approach**: The text states that the Mauryan empire's administration varied by region. \n    *   **Local Governance**: The area around Pataliputra was under 'direct control of the emperor,' where officials were appointed to collect taxes and punish disobedience. In 'other areas or provinces' like Taxila or Ujjain, rule was from a provincial capital with royal princes as governors, but 'local customs and rules were probably followed,' indicating a degree of local autonomy. 'Vast areas between these centres' had Mauryan control over 'roads and rivers' for transport. 'Forested regions' were 'more or less independent,' though expected to provide certain resources. \n    *   **Resource Collection**: Officials in the directly controlled area collected 'taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders.' In the vast areas between centers, resources were collected as 'tax and tribute,' citing examples like 'blankets' from the north-west and 'gold and precious stones' from south India. Forested regions were expected to provide 'elephants, timber, honey and wax.'\n\n2.  **Chola Empire's Approach**: The text details a more structured local administration for the Chola empire.\n    *   **Local Governance**: Settlements of peasants, 'ur,' formed larger units called 'nadu.' Both the 'village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice.' 'Rich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu' under central supervision. Brahmana landholders formed 'assemblies or sabha' in 'brahmadeya' settlements, which 'worked very efficiently' and had 'separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc.' Membership to the sabha had strict criteria including land ownership, age, knowledge of Vedas, and administrative experience, as detailed in the Uttaramerur inscription.\n    *   **Resource Collection**: The 'nadu' was responsible for 'collecting taxes.' The text mentions 'land revenue' being collected from land owned by sabha members. Temples were 'endowed with land by rulers as well as by others,' and the 'produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple.' Various 'categories of land' like 'vellanvagai' (non-Brahmana peasant proprietors), 'brahmadeya' (gifted to Brahmanas), and 'devadana' (gifted to temples) are also mentioned, implying different revenue or usage structures.\n\n3.  **Differences in Administrative Structures**: \n    *   **Directness of Control**: The Mauryan administration showed a gradient of control, from direct rule near the capital to significant local autonomy or indirect control in outlying and forested regions. The Cholas, while having a central government, delegated significant administrative functions (justice, tax collection) to highly organized local bodies like the 'nadu' and 'sabha,' which had specific rules and involved local elites (Vellala peasants, Brahmana landholders).\n    *   **Formalization of Local Bodies**: Chola administration featured formalized local self-governance structures (ur, nadu, sabha) with detailed eligibility criteria for members, suggesting a more institutionalized local administrative framework than the Mauryan system which relied more on appointed officials in directly controlled areas and local customs/princes in provinces.\n    *   **Resource Collection Mechanisms**: Mauryans collected taxes from diverse groups and tributes of specific resources based on regional availability. Cholas relied heavily on land revenue collected by local bodies and also utilized land endowments to temples as a means of supporting specialists and services, integrating religious institutions into the economic and administrative framework.\n\nAnswer: The Mauryan Empire employed a varied administrative approach, with direct control and tax collection by appointed officials in areas around Pataliputra, while provinces like Taxila and Ujjain were ruled from capitals by governors, often royal princes, who likely followed local customs. Vast intermediate areas focused on controlling transport routes and collecting resources as tax and tribute, and forested regions were largely independent, providing specific resources like elephants and timber. In contrast, the Chola Empire featured a more formalized local governance structure, with peasant settlements ('ur') forming larger units ('nadu') responsible for justice and tax collection. Rich peasants of the Vellala caste held considerable influence in the 'nadu,' and Brahmana landholders managed 'brahmadeya' settlements through highly efficient assemblies ('sabha') with detailed membership criteria. Resource collection in the Chola empire primarily involved taxes collected by the 'nadu' and land revenue, with temples also playing a significant economic role through land endowments that supported specialists."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.3", "7.2.5", "7.4.9", "7.6.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAnimals multiply naturally. Besides, if they are looked after carefully, they provide milk, which is an important source of food, and meat, whenever required. In other words, animals that are reared can be used as a \u2018store\u2019 of food \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nTake a look at Table 1 again. You will notice that after the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra until 1526. By then, Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals. This was also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs. \nSome of the states established in this period were small but powerful and extremely well administered. Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun (1530-1540, 1555-1556). Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty. Although the Sur dynasty ruled for only fifteen years (1540-1555), it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made them more efficient. Sher Shah\u2019s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar (1556-1605) when he consolidated the Mughal Empire. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFranchise \u2013 The right to vote. \n \nA Constitution is Written \n\n Between December 1946 and November 1949, some three hundred Indians had a series of meetings on the country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key features of the Indian Constitution regarding suffrage, social equality, and language, and who chaired its Drafting Committee?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text details several features of the Indian Constitution. Firstly, regarding suffrage, it adopted 'universal adult franchise,' allowing all Indians above 21 to vote, which was considered a 'revolutionary step' compared to other nations.

Nowadays most girls from middle-class families go to school, and often study with boys. On growing up, many of them go to colleges and universities, and take up jobs after that. They have to be adults before they are legally married, and according to law, they can marry anyone they like, from any caste and community, and widows can remarry too. All women, like all men, can vote and stand for elections. Of course, these rights are not actually enjoyed by all. Poor people have little or no access to education, and in many families, women cannot choose their husbands. \nTwo hundred years ago things were very different. Most children were married off at an early age. Both Hindu and Muslim men could marry more than one wife. In some parts of the country, widows were praised if they chose death by burning themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands. Women who died in this manner, whether willingly or otherwise, were called \u201csati\u201d, meaning virtuous women. Women\u2019s rights to property were also restricted. Besides, most women had virtually no access to education. In many parts of the country people believed that if a woman was educated, she would become a widow. \nDifferences between men and women were not the only ones in society. In most regions, people were divided along lines of caste. Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered themselves as \u201cupper castes\u201d. Others, such as traders and moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were placed after them. Then came peasants, and artisans such as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras). At the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep cities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper castes considered \u201cpolluting\u201d, that is, it could lead to the loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated many of these groups at the bottom as \u201cuntouchable\u201d. They were not allowed to enter temples, draw water from the wells used by the upper castes, or bathe in ponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as inferior human beings. Over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many of these norms and perceptions slowly changed. Let us see how this happened. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the significant differences in the lives and rights of women two hundred years ago compared to women's lives and rights nowadays?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text directly contrasts the conditions of women 'nowadays' with 'two hundred years ago'. \n\nFor 'nowadays', the text mentions that most girls from middle-class families go to school, study with boys, go to colleges/universities, take up jobs, marry as adults, can choose their spouse from any caste/community, and widows can remarry. Furthermore, all women can vote and stand for elections.\n\nIn stark contrast, 'two hundred years ago', most children were married off at an early age. Men (both Hindu and Muslim) could have multiple wives. Widows were praised for performing 'sati' (burning themselves on their husband's pyre), and their rights to property were restricted. Most women had virtually no access to education, and it was believed that educated women would become widows.\n\nTherefore, the differences span across education, marriage age and choice, marital practices (polygamy vs. monogamy, widow remarriage), property rights, and political participation.\n\nAnswer: Two hundred years ago, women experienced early marriage, men could marry multiple wives, widows were expected to perform 'sati,' property rights were restricted, and they had virtually no access to education, often due to superstitions. Nowadays, women generally attend school, pursue higher education and jobs, marry as adults by choice, widows can remarry, and they possess voting and electoral rights."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.8.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

These indicate that people, perhaps belonging to the same family, were buried in the same place though not at the same time.

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMost prashastis also mention the ancestors of the ruler. This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full of learned people, including Kalidasa the poet, and Aryabhata the astronomer, about whom you will read more in Chapter 12. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors contributed to the rise of Masulipatnam as a significant port in the 17th century and its eventual decline by the 18th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text provides several reasons for Masulipatnam's importance and subsequent decline. Its rise was due to its location on the delta of the Krishna river, which made it a 'centre of intense activity' and the 'most important port on the Andhra coast' in the seventeenth century. The 'convenience of the road' (a place for ships to anchor) made it a residence for merchants once the Dutch and English nations frequented the coast. Fierce competition among various trading groups\u2014including Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders\u2014further made the city 'populous and prosperous'. The Dutch also built a fort there.\n\nThe decline of Masulipatnam began when the Mughals extended their power to Golconda, with Emperor Aurangzeb annexing it in 1686-1687. This event caused the European Companies to 'look for alternatives'. The English East India Company adopted a new policy, seeking trade centers that would 'combine political, administrative and commercial roles', rather than just having connections with production centers. As the Company traders subsequently moved to Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, Masulipatnam 'lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century'.\n\nAnswer: Masulipatnam rose to prominence in the 17th century as a key port on the Krishna river delta due to its strategic location, convenience for shipping, intense trading activity by various groups including European companies, and the establishment of a Dutch fort. Its decline in the 18th century was triggered by the Mughal annexation of Golconda, which prompted European companies to seek new trading hubs. The English East India Company, in particular, shifted its focus to centers like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras that offered combined political, administrative, and commercial roles, leading to Masulipatnam's loss of merchants and prosperity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.8", "6.11.4", "7.6.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh.

They drew upon the ideals of love and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages they visited, and set them to music. \nThere were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different caste backgrounds such as potters, \u201cuntouchable\u201d workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and chiefs. The best known among them were Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are two sets of compilations of their songs \u2013 Tevaram and Tiruvacakam. There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally divergent backgrounds, the best known being Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya Prabandham. \nBetween the tenth and twelfth centuries the Chola and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening the links between the bhakti tradition and temple worship. This was also the time when their poems were compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also composed. Today we use these texts as sources for writing histories of the bhakti tradition. \nHagiography : Writing of saints\u2019 lives. \nThis is a composition of Manikkavasagar: Into my vile body of flesh You came, as though it were a temple of gold, And soothed me wholly and saved me, O Lord of Grace, O Gem most Pure, Sorrow and birth and death and illusion You took from me, and set me free. O Bliss! O Light! I have taken refuge in You, And never can I be parted from You. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTraditional food habits are generally based on locally available items of food. Bengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist monasteries) depict scenes of fish being dressed and taken to the market in baskets. \nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat nonvegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for the Bengal Brahmanas. The Brihaddharma Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction. Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the two primary architectural styles employed in monuments, and what significant technological advancements emerged from the twelfth century to facilitate construction?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes two main architectural styles.

He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMost of Egypt is a dry desert, except for the lands along the river Nile \nAround 5000 years ago, kings ruled over Egypt. These kings sent armies to distant lands to get gold, silver, ivory, timber, and precious stones. They also built huge tombs, known as pyramids. \nWhen they died, the bodies of kings were preserved and buried in these pyramids. These carefully preserved bodies are known as \u2018mummies\u2019. A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFrom the sixteenth century, people began to migrate in large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal to the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern Bengal. As they moved eastwards, they cleared forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new communities of peasants. \nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries received land and often set up mosques that served as centres for religious transformation in these areas. \nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. These were provided by community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People referred to them with affection and respect as pirs. \nPir : A Persian word meaning a spiritual guide. \nThis term included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal. \nAnimism : Attribution of living soul to plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena. \nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapters 2 and 5) that temples and other religious structures were often built by individuals or groups who were becoming powerful \u2013 to both demonstrate their power and proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several \u201clow\u201d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). The coming of the European trading companies created new economic opportunities; many families belonging to these social groups availed of these. As their social and economic position improved, they proclaimed their status through the construction of temples. When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts. (Remember the \u201cBangla dome\u201d in Chapter 5?) This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in temple architecture. \nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. Temples were usually built on a square platform. The interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, such decorations reached a high degree of excellence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did British educational policy in India evolve from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, and what were the key viewpoints that shaped these changes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes the evolution of British educational policy in India. Initially, in the late 18th century, the 'tradition of Orientalism' prevailed. Figures like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, and Nathaniel Halhed advocated for promoting Indian learning, including ancient Indian texts, Sanskrit, and Persian, to understand Indian culture and win the respect of the 'natives'. This led to the establishment of the Calcutta Madrasa in 1781 and the Hindu College in Benaras in 1791. However, from the early 19th century, many British officials, such as James Mill, began to criticize Orientalism, arguing that Eastern knowledge was flawed and that education should focus on what was 'useful and practical', primarily Western scientific and technical advances. This criticism intensified by the 1830s with Thomas Babington Macaulay, who strongly advocated for teaching the English language, believing it would 'civilise people' and introduce them to Western literature, science, and philosophy. Macaulay's influence led to the English Education Act of 1835, which made English the medium of instruction for higher education and ceased the promotion of Oriental institutions. The policy further evolved with 'Wood\u2019s Despatch' in 1854, which re-emphasized the practical and economic benefits of European learning, aiming to create demand for British goods and facilitate trade. This Despatch led to the establishment of education departments and universities in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay by 1857. Additionally, Christian missionaries also advocated for moral education through Christian teachings, though the East India Company and later the British government had reservations about directly supporting it.\n\nAnswer: British educational policy in India evolved from an initial Orientalist approach in the late 18th century, which sought to promote Indian learning and ancient texts through institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa (1781) and Hindu College (1791). This was challenged from the early 19th century by critics like James Mill, who advocated for 'useful and practical' Western education. By the 1830s, Thomas Babington Macaulay's strong advocacy for English language instruction, viewing Indian knowledge as inferior, led to the English Education Act of 1835, making English the medium for higher education. Further, the 1854 Wood's Despatch solidified the emphasis on European learning for its practical and economic benefits, leading to the establishment of education departments and universities by 1857. Christian missionaries also pushed for moral education, though their efforts faced initial resistance from the Company and later the government."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.7.1", "6.4.11", "7.5.5", "7.9.8", "7.8.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This fundamentally differed from the Mughal rulers' general strategy, who constantly campaigned against those who refused their authority to extend their influence, even if they often treated defeated opponents honourably to integrate them rather than abandoning conquest altogether."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.6", "7.4.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

We have used the word \u2018pasts\u2019 in plural to draw attention to the fact that the past was different for different groups of people. For example, the lives of herders or farmers were different from those of kings and queens, the lives of merchants were different from those of crafts persons, and so on. Also, as is true even today, people followed different practices and customs in different parts  of the country. For example, today most people living in the Andaman Islands get their own food by fishing, hunting, and collecting forest produce. By contrast, most people living in cities depend on others for supplies of food. Differences such as these existed in the past as well. \nBesides, there is another kind of difference. We know a great deal about kings and the battles they fought because they kept records of their victories. Generally, ordinary people such as hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers or herders did not keep records of what they did. While archaeology helps us to find out about their lives, there is much that remains unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nCrops for Europe \n\n The British also realised that the countryside could not only yield revenue, it could also grow the crops that Europe required. By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nStone tools were probably made using two different techniques: 1. The first is called stone on stone. Here, the pebble from which the tool was to be made (also called the core) was held in one hand. Another stone, which was used as a hammer was held in the other hand. The second stone was used to strike off flakes from the first, till the required shape was obtained. 2. Pressure flaking: Here the core was placed on a firm surface. The hammer stone was used on a piece of bone or stone that was placed on the core, to remove flakes that could be shaped into tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nTemples and mosques were beautifully constructed because they were places of worship. They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the multiple functions of temples and mosques for rulers, and how did both Hindu kings and Muslim Sultans associate themselves with divine power through these constructions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the first section explicitly states that temples and mosques were built not only as places of worship but also to 'demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron.' It further mentions that constructing places of worship gave rulers the opportunity to 'proclaim their close relationship with God.' For Hindu kings, the example of King Rajarajadeva is given, where he took his god's name, Rajarajeshvaram, because it was 'auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god.' The text highlights that 'through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram),' and that the temple represented a 'miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies,' where their worship seemed to bring 'the just rule of the gods on earth.'

An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he possessed qualities like 'Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past.'\n\nAnswer: Beyond being places of worship, temples and mosques served to demonstrate the power, wealth, and devotion of the patron, and allowed rulers to proclaim their close relationship with God. Hindu kings, like Rajarajadeva, associated themselves with divinity by adopting names similar to their gods to appear god-like and through rituals where the king, seen as a god, honored another deity. The temple was also a miniature model of the king's world, symbolizing divine endorsement of his rule. Muslim Sultans and Padshahs, while not claiming to be incarnations of God, were described as the 'Shadow of God,' with figures like Alauddin being chosen by God for their qualities as great lawgivers."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.5.3", "6.1.5", "6.2.4", "8.3.2", "6.7.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nZoroaster was an Iranian prophet. His teachings are contained in a book called the Avesta. The language of the Avesta, and the practices described in it are very similar to those of the Vedas. The basic teachings of Zoroaster are contained in the maxim \u201cGood thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.\u201d Here is a verse from the Zend Avesta: \u201cLord, grant strength and the rule of truth and good thinking, by means of which one shall create peace and tranquillity.\u201d \nFor more than a thousand years, Zoroastrianism was a major religion in Iran. Later, some Zoroastrians migrated from Iran and settled down in the coastal towns of Gujarat and Maharashtra. They were the ancestors of today\u2019s Parsis. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the core principles of Ashoka's dhamma and what specific actions did he take to propagate it and resolve societal challenges within his empire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the first section explains Ashoka's dhamma.

The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Delhi Sultans overcome their early limitations and expand their authority across the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that in the early thirteenth century, the Delhi Sultans' control was limited to heavily fortified garrison towns, and they were dependent on external sources for supplies, as they seldom controlled the hinterland.

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe city of Dholavira was located on Khadir Beyt (also spelled as Bet) in the Rann of Kutch, where there was fresh water and fertile soil. Unlike some of the other Harappan cities, which were divided into two parts, Dholavira was divided into three parts, and each part was surrounded with massive stone walls, with entrances through gateways. There was also a large open area in the settlement, where public ceremonies could be held. Other finds include large letters of the Harappan script that were carved out of white stone and perhaps inlaid in wood. This is a unique find as generally Harappan writing has been found on small objects such as seals. \nThe city of Lothal stood beside a tributary of the Sabarmati, in Gujarat, close to the Gulf of Khambat. It was situated near areas where raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available. This was an important centre for making objects out of stone, shell and metal. There was also a store house in the city. Many seals and sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were found in this storehouse. \nA building that was found here was probably a workshop for making beads: pieces of stone, half made beads, tools for bead making, and finished beads have all been found here. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What unique artifact was discovered in Dholavira, and what severe economic consequence did Bengal face due to the East India Company's initial revenue policies before the Permanent Settlement was introduced?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question asks about a unique artifact in Dholavira.

Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAround 3500 years ago, we find some of the first evidence of writing in China. \nThese writings were on animal bones. These are called oracle bones, because they were used to predict the future. Kings got scribes to write questions on the bones \u2014 would they win battles? Would the harvest be good? Would they have sons? The bones were then put into the fire, and they cracked because of the heat. Then fortunetellers studied these cracks, and tried to predict the future. As you may expect, they sometimes made mistakes. \nThese kings lived in palaces in cities. They amassed vast quantities of wealth, including large, elaborately decorated bronze vessels.

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done?

The text first introduces the East India Company becoming the Diwan of Bengal in 1765, necessitating the organization of revenue resources. Initially, the Company aimed to increase revenue without a regular system, leading to an economic crisis and famine in Bengal.\n2. To address the need for reliable revenue, the Company introduced the 'Permanent Settlement' in 1793. Under this system, rajas and taluqdars were recognized as zamindars, responsible for collecting rent from peasants and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. This was intended to ensure a regular flow of revenue and encourage zamindars to invest in land improvement.\n3. The problems with the Permanent Settlement are detailed: Company officials found that zamindars were not investing in land improvement, as the fixed revenue was initially too high, leading to many zamindaris being sold off when payments failed. Later, as market prices rose and cultivation expanded, the zamindars' income increased, but the Company gained nothing due to the permanently fixed revenue. Furthermore, cultivators found the system oppressive, facing high rents, insecure land rights, and often eviction.\n4. Due to these issues and the Company's need for more revenue, new systems were devised. In the North Western Provinces, Holt Mackenzie introduced the 'mahalwari settlement' in 1822. This system involved calculating the revenue for each village (mahal) based on field surveys and customs, with the demand revised periodically, and the village headman responsible for collection.\n5. In the British territories in the south, the 'Munro system' or 'ryotwari' was developed by Captain Alexander Read and Thomas Munro. This system involved direct settlement with the cultivators (ryots) after careful and separate surveys of their fields, with the British intending to act as paternal protectors.\n6. The text notes that even with these new systems, high revenue demands often led to peasants being unable to pay, ryots fleeing, and villages becoming deserted.\n7. The second text section discusses ancient Rome and its infrastructure, which is not relevant to the East India Company's revenue systems in India.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company implemented several revenue settlement systems in India. The first major system was the Permanent Settlement, introduced in 1793, which recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars responsible for collecting rent and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. Later, the mahalwari settlement was devised in the North Western Provinces in 1822, which calculated revenue for each village (mahal) with periodically revised demands collected by the village headman. In the south, the ryotwari (or Munro) system was introduced, making settlements directly with cultivators (ryots) after surveying their fields.\n\nThe Permanent Settlement created several problems: zamindars often failed to invest in land improvement because the fixed revenue was too high, leading to the sale of many zamindaris.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the methods by which the muvendar accumulated wealth and power in ancient South India, and identify the key grievances that fueled the predicted 'massive upheaval' against British rule."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer the first part of the question, I will refer to the first text section. The text states that 'Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful,' specifically mentioning the muvendar (Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas). Their methods of accumulating wealth and power included demanding and receiving gifts from the people instead of regular taxes, and going on military expeditions to collect tribute from neighboring areas. They would keep some of this wealth and distribute the rest among their supporters, including family, soldiers, and poets, who were often rewarded with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth.\n\nFor the second part of the question, I will refer to the second text section, which discusses the 'massive upheaval' during British rule. According to Vishnubhatt Godse's account, a primary grievance was the belief that the English were 'determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims' through a list of eighty-four rules that kings refused to accept, leading to plans for a 'war of religion.' Sitaram Pande's memoirs add that the 'seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust.' Additionally, agents incited sepoys by highlighting British treachery and promising the restoration of the Emperor of Delhi. A significant grievance was the report that new rifle cartridges were 'greased with the fat of cows and pigs,' which would defile both Mahommedans and Hindus, leading to the belief that the English aimed to convert them to Christians.\n\nAnswer: In ancient South India, the muvendar (Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas) accumulated wealth and power by controlling fertile river valleys like the Kaveri and coastal areas. They did not collect regular taxes but instead demanded and received gifts from the people. They also conducted military expeditions to collect tribute from neighboring regions, distributing a portion of this wealth among their supporters, including family, soldiers, and poets.\n\nDuring British rule, key grievances fueling the predicted 'massive upheaval' included the widespread belief among sepoys that the English intended to eradicate Hindu and Muslim religions, as evidenced by the introduction of 'eighty-four rules' that kings rejected. The 'seizing of Oudh' also generated significant distrust. Furthermore, the introduction of new rifle cartridges rumored to be greased with the fat of cows and pigs was perceived as a deliberate attempt to defile the religions of both Hindus and Muslims and convert them to Christianity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.2", "8.5.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Given below are the important changes that were introduced by the British. \n1. The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of Indian affairs. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a council to advise him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. Through these measures the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India. \n2. All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as subordinates of the British Crown. \n3. It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4. The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British believed that they were responsible for the rebellion in a big way. \n 5. The British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India. \n 6. Policies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and give them security of rights over their lands. \n Thus a new phase of history began after 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nOstriches were found in India during the Palaeolithic period.

A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe sword of Tipu Sultan and Wootz steel \n\n We begin the story of Indian steel and iron metallurgy by recounting the famous story of Tipu Sultan who ruled Mysore till 1799, fought four wars with the British and died fighting with his sword in his hand. Tipu\u2019s legendary swords are now part of valuable collections in museums in England. But do you know why the sword was so special? The sword had an incredibly hard and sharp edge that could easily rip through the opponent\u2019s armour. This quality of the sword came from a special type of high carbon steel called Wootz which was produced all over south India. Wootz steel when made into swords produced a very sharp edge with a flowing water pattern. This pattern came from very small carbon crystals embedded in the iron. \nFrancis Buchanan who toured through Mysore in 1800, a year after Tipu Sultan\u2019s death, has left us an account of the technique by which Wootz steel was produced in many hundreds of smelting furnaces in Mysore. In these furnaces, iron was mixed with charcoal and put inside small clay pots. Through an intricate control of temperatures the smelters produced steel ingots that were used for sword making not just in India but in West and Central Asia too. Wootz is an anglicised version of the Kannada word ukku, Telugu hukku and Tamil and Malayalam urukku \u2013 meaning steel. \nIndian Wootz steel fascinated European scientists. Michael Faraday, the legendary scientist and discoverer of electricity and electromagnetism, spent four years studying the properties of Indian Wootz (1818-22). However, the Wootz steel making process, which was so widely known in south India, was completely lost by the mid-nineteenth century. Can you guess why this was so? The swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India. \nAbandoned furnaces in villages \n Production of Wootz steel required a highly specialised technique of refining iron. But iron smelting in India was extremely common till the end of the nineteenth century. In Bihar and Central India, in particular, every district had smelters that used local deposits of ore to produce iron which was widely used for the manufacture of implements and tools of daily use. The furnaces were most often built of clay and sun-dried bricks. The smelting was done by men while women worked the bellows, pumping air that kept the charcoal burning. \nBy the late nineteenth century, however, the craft of iron smelting was in decline. In most villages, furnaces fell into disuse and the amount of iron produced came down. Why was this so? One reason was the new forest laws that you have read about (Chapter 4). When the colonial government prevented people from entering the reserved forests, how could the iron smelters find wood for charcoal? Where could they get iron ore? Defying forest laws, they often entered the forests secretly and collected wood, but they could not sustain their occupation on this basis for long. Many gave up their craft and looked for other means of livelihood. \nIn some areas the government did grant access to the forest. But the iron smelters had to pay a very high tax to the forest department for every furnace they used. This reduced their income. Moreover, by the late nineteenth century iron and steel was being imported from Britain. Ironsmiths in India began using the imported iron to manufacture utensils and implements. This inevitably lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters. By the early twentieth century, the artisans producing iron and steel faced a new competition. \nIron and steel factories come up in India \n The year was 1904. In the hot month of April, Charles Weld, an American geologist and Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of Jamsetji Tata, were travelling in Chhattisgarh in search of iron ore deposits. They had spent many months on a costly venture looking for sources of good iron ore to set up a modern iron and steel plant in India. Jamsetji Tata had decided to spend a large part of his fortune to build a big iron and steel industry in India. But this could not be done without identifying the source of fine quality iron ore. \nOne day, after travelling for many hours in the forests, Weld and Dorabji came upon a small village and found a group of men and women carrying basketloads of iron ore. These people were the Agarias. When asked where they had found the iron ore, the Agarias pointed to a hill in the distance. Weld and Dorabji reached the hill after an exhausting trek through dense forests. On exploring the hill the geologist declared that they had at last found what they had been looking for. Rajhara Hills had one of the finest ores in the world. \nBut there was a problem. The region was dry and water \u2013 necessary for running the factory \u2013 was not to be found nearby. The Tatas had to continue their search for a more suitable place to set up their factory. However, the Agarias helped in the discovery of a source of iron ore that would later supply the Bhilai Steel Plant. A few years later a large area of forest was cleared on the banks of the river Subarnarekha to set up the factory and an industrial township \u2013 Jamshedpur. Here there was water near iron ore deposits. The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) that came up began producing steel in 1912. \nTISCO was set up at an opportune time. All through the late nineteenth century, India was importing steel that was manufactured in Britain. Expansion of the railways in India had provided a huge market for rails that Britain produced. For a long while, British experts in the Indian Railways were unwilling to believe that good quality steel could be produced in India. \nBy the time TISCO was set up the situation was changing. In 1914 the First World War broke out. Steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe. So imports of British steel into India declined dramatically and the Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails. As the war dragged on for several years, TISCO had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war. By 1919 the colonial government was buying 90 per cent of the steel manufactured by TISCO. Over time TISCO became the biggest steel industry within the British empire. \nIn the case of iron and steel, as in the case of cotton textiles, industrial expansion occurred only when British imports into India declined and the market for Indian industrial goods increased. This happened during the First World War and after. As the nationalist movement developed and the industrial class became stronger, the demand for government protection became louder. Struggling to retain its control over India, the British government had to concede many of these demands in the last decades of colonial rule. \nBellows \u2013 A device or equipment that can pump air. \n Slag heaps \u2013 The waste left when smelting metal. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did British rule transform both the administrative structure of India and its indigenous steel industry after the mid-19th century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text details changes in India's administrative structure and the fate of its steel industry under British rule. \n\nFirstly, regarding administrative structure, the text states that after the end of 1859, the British introduced significant changes. The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858, transferring the powers of the East India Company directly to the British Crown, ensuring 'a more responsible management of Indian affairs'. A Secretary of State for India was appointed, advised by the India Council, and the Governor-General was given the title of Viceroy, becoming a 'personal representative of the Crown'. Ruling chiefs were assured that their territories would not be annexed and could pass kingdoms to heirs, but they had to acknowledge the British Queen as 'Sovereign Paramount'. The proportion of Indian soldiers in the army was reduced, European soldiers increased, and recruitment shifted to groups like Gurkhas, Sikhs, and Pathans. Muslims faced large-scale confiscation of land and property and were treated with 'suspicion and hostility'. Policies were also made to protect landlords and zamindars, and the British decided to respect 'customary religious and social practices' (Section 1).\n\nSecondly, concerning the indigenous steel industry, the text explains its decline and later, the rise of a modern steel plant. The 'Wootz steel making process', widely known in south India and studied by Michael Faraday, was 'completely lost by the mid-nineteenth century'. This was because the 'swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India'. Iron smelting in India generally declined by the late nineteenth century due to 'new forest laws' that prevented smelters from accessing wood for charcoal and iron ore, and due to high taxes imposed for forest access. Additionally, 'iron and steel was being imported from Britain', which 'lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters'. However, the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was set up, beginning steel production in 1912. TISCO's growth was significantly boosted by the First World War (1914), as 'steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe', causing British steel imports into India to 'declined dramatically'. The Indian Railways and the colonial government then turned to TISCO for supplies, leading to its expansion and making it 'the biggest steel industry within the British empire' by 1919 (Section 5).\n\nAnswer: After the mid-19th century, British rule fundamentally altered India's administrative structure by transferring power from the East India Company to the British Crown in 1858, establishing a Secretary of State for India and a Viceroy, assuring ruling chiefs of non-annexation while asserting British paramountcy, restructuring the army, confiscating Muslim land, and protecting landlords. Concurrently, the indigenous steel industry faced significant decline; the Wootz steel-making process was lost, and local iron smelting dwindled due to British conquest, imports of British steel, and restrictive forest laws. However, the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) emerged and expanded significantly during World War I when British steel imports decreased, leading to TISCO becoming the largest steel industry within the British Empire."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.5.5", "6.4.11", "6.2.10", "6.1.1", "8.6.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants.

However, after independence the Congress did not take any steps to honour this promise. For India had been divided on the basis of religion: despite the wishes and efforts of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom had come not to one nation but to two. As a result of the partition of India, more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims. Could the country afford further divisions on the basis of language? \nBoth Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel were against the creation of linguistic states. After the Partition, Nehru said, \u201cdisruptionist tendencies had come to the fore\u201d; to check them, the nation had to be strong and united. Or, as Patel put it: ... the first and last need of India at the present moment is that it should be made a nation \u2026 Everything which helps the growth of nationalism has to go forward and everything which throws obstacles in its way has to be rejected \u2026 We have applied this test to linguistic provinces also, and by this test, in our opinion [they] cannot be supported. \nThat the Congress leaders would now go back on their promise created great disappointment. The Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, the Marathi speakers, had all looked forward to having their own state. The strongest protests, however, came from the Telugu-speaking districts of what was the Madras Presidency. When Nehru went to campaign there during the general elections of 1952, he was met with black flags and slogans demanding \u201cWe want Andhra\u201d. In October of that year, a veteran Gandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger strike demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast went on, it attracted much support. Hartals and bandhs were observed in many towns. \nOn 15 December 1952, fifty-eight days into his fast, Potti Sriramulu died. As a newspaper put it, \u201cthe news of the passing away of Sriramulu engulfed entire Andhra in chaos\u201d. The protests were so widespread and intense that the central government was forced to give in to the demand. Thus, on 1 October 1953, the new state of Andhra came into being, which subsequently became Andhra Pradesh. \nAfter the creation of Andhra, other linguistic communities also demanded their own separate states. A States Reorganisation Commission was set up, which submitted its report in 1956, recommending the redrawing of district and provincial boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu speakers respectively. The large Hindi-speaking region of north India was also to be broken up into several states. A little later, in 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided into separate states for Marathi and Gujarati speakers. In 1966, the state of Punjab was also divided into Punjab and Haryana, the former for the Punjabi speakers (who were also mostly Sikhs), the latter for the rest (who spoke not Punjabi but versions of Haryanvi or Hindi). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for the initial reluctance of the Indian National Congress leaders to form states based on linguistic groups after independence, and how did the British Company's motivations for reforming vernacular education differ in their approach to existing local systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Reasons for Congress's reluctance:** The text explicitly states that after independence, the Congress did not honor its promise of linguistic provinces because \"India had been divided on the basis of religion\" which resulted in \"more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims.\" Both Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel opposed linguistic states, emphasizing that \"the nation had to be strong and united\" to counter \"disruptionist tendencies.\" Patel further stated that \"the first and last need of India at the present moment is that it should be made a nation\u2026 Everything which helps the growth of nationalism has to go forward.\" By this test, linguistic provinces \"cannot be supported.\" \n2. **British Company's motivations for education reform:** The text explains that the Company initially \"allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference\" until the mid-nineteenth century, being \"concerned primarily with higher education.\" However, \"After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education.\" Their motivation was to introduce \"order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections.\" This indicates a desire for standardization and control over the existing flexible system, rather than a concern about national division. \n3. **Difference in motivations:** The Congress leaders' reluctance was primarily driven by a fear of further national fragmentation and a strong desire for national unity following the violent religious partition. In contrast, the British Company's motivation for educational reform was to impose a standardized, regulated structure and 'order' on the previously flexible indigenous education system, which they viewed as needing improvement, rather than to prevent national division.\n\nAnswer: The Indian National Congress leaders were initially reluctant to form linguistic states due to the recent traumatic Partition of India on religious lines, fearing further national division and prioritizing a strong, united nation. The British Company's motivations for reforming vernacular education, however, differed as they sought to introduce \"order,\" \"routines,\" and \"rules\" to standardize and control the existing flexible local pathshala system, rather than being driven by concerns of national fragmentation."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.10.3", "8.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This was an age when Islam, Brahmanical Hinduism, Sufism, various strands of bhakti, and the Nathpanths, Siddhas and Yogis influenced one another. We saw that new towns (Chapter 6) and kingdoms (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new professions and finding new roles for themselves. Such people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and labourers, thronged to listen to these new saints and spread their ideas. \nSome of them like Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak rejected all orthodox religions. Others like Tulsidas and Surdas accepted existing beliefs and practices but wanted to make these accessible to all. Tulsidas conceived of God in the form of Rama. Tulsidas\u2019s composition, the Ramcharitmanas, written in Awadhi (a language used in eastern Uttar Pradesh), is important both as an expression of his devotion and as a literary work. Surdas was an ardent devotee of Krishna. His compositions, compiled in the Sursagara, Surasaravali and Sahitya Lahari, express his devotion. Also contemporary was Shankaradeva of Assam (late fifteenth century) who emphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems and plays in Assamese. He began the practice of setting up namghars or houses of recitation and prayer, a practice that continues to date. \nThe essence of Shankaradeva\u2019s devotion came to be known as Eka Sarana Nama Dharma (supreme surrender to the One). The teachings of Shankaradeva were based on the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavata Purana. He also encouraged the establishment of satra or monasteries for transmission of knowledge. His major compositions included Kirtana-ghosha. \nThis tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal, Ravidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth century. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint from a caste considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d. She was devoted to Krishna and composed innumerable bhajans expressing her intense devotion. Her songs also openly challenged the norms of the \u201cupper\u201d castes and became popular with the masses in Rajasthan and Gujarat. \nA unique feature of most of the saints is that their works were composed in regional languages and could be sung. They became immensely popular and were handed down orally from generation to generation. Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and women transmitted these songs, often adding their own experiences. Thus the songs as we have them today are as much a creation of the saints as of generations of people who sang them. They have become a part of our living popular culture. \nThis is a song composed by Mirabai: Ranaji, I have left your norms of shame, and false decorum of the princely life. I have left your town. And yet Rana why have you kept up enmity against me? Rana you gave me a cup of poison. I drank it laughing. Rana I will not be destroyed by you. And yet Rana why have you kept up enmity against me? \nAn important contribution of Bhakti saints was towards the development of music. Jayadeva of Bengal composed the Gita Govinda in Sanskrit, each song composed in a particular raga and tala. A significant impact that these saints had on music was the use of bhajan, kirtan and abhang. These songs which emphasised on emotional experience had a tremendous appeal to the common people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFrom the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns. These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain. Some of these taxes were collected in kind, while others were collected in cash. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Agenda for a National Education \n\n British officials were not the only people thinking about education in India. From the early nineteenth century many thinkers from different parts of India began to talk of the need for a wider spread of education. Impressed with the developments in Europe, some Indians felt that Western education would help modernise India. They urged the British to open more schools, colleges and universities, and spend more money on education. There were other Indians, however, who reacted against Western education. Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore were two such individuals. Let us look at what they had to say. \n\u201cEnglish education has enslaved us\u201d \n Mahatma Gandhi argued that colonial education created a sense of inferiority in the minds of Indians. It made them see Western civilisation as superior, and destroyed the pride they had in their own culture. There was poison in this education, said Mahatma Gandhi, it was sinful, it enslaved Indians, it cast an evil spell on them. Charmed by the West, appreciating everything that came fr om the West, Indians educated in these institutions began admiring British rule. Mahatma Gandhi wanted an education that could help Indians recover their sense of dignity and self-respect. During the national movement he urged students to leave educational institutions in order to show to the British that Indians were no longer willing to be enslaved. \nMahatma Gandhi strongly felt that Indian languages ought to be the medium of teaching. Education in English crippled Indians, distanced them from their own social surroundings, and made them \u201cstrangers in their own lands\u201d. Speaking a foreign tongue, despising local culture, the English educated did not know how to relate to the masses. \nWestern education, Mahatma Gandhi said, focused on reading and writing rather than oral knowledge; it valued textbooks rather than lived experience and practical knowledge. He argued that education ought to develop a person\u2019s mind and soul. Literacy \u2013 or simply learning to read and write \u2013 by itself did not count as education. People had to work with their hands, learn a craft, and know how different things operated. This would develop their mind and their capacity to understand. As nationalist sentiments spread, other thinkers also began thinking of a system of national education which would be radically different from that set up by the British. \nTagore\u2019s \u201cabode of peace\u201d \n Many of you may have heard of Santiniketan. Do you know why it was established and by whom? Rabindranath Tagore started the institution in 1901. As a child, Tagore hated going to school. He found it suffocating and oppressive. The school appeared like a prison, for he could never do what he felt like doing. So while other children listened to the teacher, Tagore\u2019s mind would wander away. \nThe experience of his schooldays in Calcutta shaped Tagore\u2019s ideas of education. On growing up, he wanted to set up a school where the child was happy, where she could be free and creative, where she was able to explore her own thoughts and desires. Tagore felt that childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside the rigid and restricting discipline of the schooling system set up by the British. Teachers had to be imaginative, understand the child, and help the child develop her curiosity. According to Tagore, the existing schools killed the natural desire of the child to be creative, her sense of wonder. \nTagore was of the view that creative learning could be encouraged only within a natural environment. So he chose to set up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural setting. He saw it as an abode of peace (santiniketan ), where living in harmony with nature, children could cultivate their natural creativity. \nIn many senses Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi thought about education in similar ways. There were, however, differences too. Gandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship of machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements of modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within Indian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and technology at Santiniketan, along with art, music and dance. \nMany individuals and thinkers were thus thinking about the way a national educational system could be fashioned. Some wanted changes within the system set up by the British, and felt that the system could be extended so as to include wider sections of people. Others urged that alternative systems be created so that people were educated into a culture that was truly national. Who was to define what was truly national? The debate about what this \u201cnational education\u201d ought to be continued till after independence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, how did regional languages and traditional Indian knowledge contribute to societal and cultural development during the Bhakti movement and in Mahatma Gandhi's vision for national education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires synthesizing information from two distinct periods discussed in the text: the Bhakti movement (Section 2) and Mahatma Gandhi's educational philosophy (Section 3). \n\n1.  **Bhakti Movement (Section 2):** The text explicitly states that 'A unique feature of most of the saints is that their works were composed in regional languages and could be sung.' Examples include Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas in Awadhi, Shankaradeva's poems and plays in Assamese, and Mirabai's bhajans. These compositions made spiritual ideas 'accessible to all' and became 'immensely popular,' 'handed down orally from generation to generation,' often by 'poorest, most deprived communities and women.' This facilitated the spread of their ideas, challenged 'upper' caste norms (Mirabai), and significantly contributed to the development of music through 'bhajan, kirtan and abhang,' becoming 'a part of our living popular culture.' Thus, regional languages were crucial for mass communication, cultural preservation, and musical innovation.\n\n2.  **Mahatma Gandhi's Vision for National Education (Section 3):** Mahatma Gandhi 'strongly felt that Indian languages ought to be the medium of teaching.' He argued that 'Education in English crippled Indians, distanced them from their own social surroundings, and made them \u201cstrangers in their own lands.\u201d' He also valued 'oral knowledge' and 'lived experience and practical knowledge' over 'textbooks,' advocating that 'People had to work with their hands, learn a craft,' to develop their 'mind and soul.' He believed this approach would help Indians 'recover their sense of dignity and self-respect' and pride in 'their own culture.' Therefore, for Gandhi, regional languages and traditional practical knowledge were essential for maintaining cultural identity, fostering self-respect, and providing holistic education rooted in local context.\n\nIn summary, both periods highlight the critical role of regional languages and traditional knowledge in empowering people, preserving culture, and fostering a sense of identity, albeit in different societal contexts (religious-cultural spread versus national education).\n\nAnswer: During the Bhakti movement, regional languages were vital for saints like Tulsidas, Shankaradeva, and Mirabai to compose and spread devotional ideas, making them accessible to common people and challenging social norms through popular songs and oral traditions. In Mahatma Gandhi's vision for national education, Indian languages were deemed essential as the medium of teaching to prevent cultural alienation, foster self-respect, and connect individuals to their social surroundings. He also emphasized traditional practical knowledge and crafts as fundamental to developing a person's mind and soul, advocating for an education rooted in lived experience rather than solely textbooks."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.4", "7.8.9", "8.7.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Take a look at Table 1 again and identify the five dynasties that together made the Delhi Sultanate. \nThe rulers of Delhi - Table 1 - RAJPUT DYNASTIES : Tomaras Early twelfth century-1165, Ananga Pala 1130-1145, Chauhans 1165-1192, Prithviraj Chauhan 1175-1192 - EARLY TURKISH RULERS 1206-1290 : Qutbuddin Aybak 1206-1210, Shamsuddin Iltutmish 1210-1236, Raziyya 1236-1240, Ghiyasuddin Balban 1266-1287 - KHALJI DYNASTY 1290-1320 : Jalaluddin Khalji 1290-1296, Alauddin Khalji 1296-1316 - TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 1320-1414 : Ghiyasuddin Tughluq 1320-1324, Muhammad Tughluq 1324-1351, Firuz Shah Tughluq 1351-1388 - SAYYID DYNASTY 1414-1451 : Khizr Khan 1414-1421 - LODI DYNASTY 1451-1526 : Bahlul Lodi 1451-1489 \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments. Among them were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis. They advocated renunciation of the world. To them the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realisation of oneness with it. To achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation. These groups became particularly popular among \u201clow\u201d castes. Their criticism of conventional religion created the ground for devotional religion to become a popular force in northern India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHow did the Cholas rise to power? A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the various types of local assemblies in the Pallava and Chola periods, and elaborate on the detailed organizational structure and membership requirements of the sabha during the Chola era."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify Pallava Assemblies:** The first text section explicitly mentions the local assemblies during the Pallava period: the `sabha` (assembly of brahmin landowners), the `ur` (village assembly for non-brahmin landowners), and the `nagaram` (organization of merchants).\n2. **Identify Chola Assemblies:** The second text section describes local assemblies in the Chola period, noting that `ur` were settlements of peasants which, when grouped, formed `nadu` for administrative functions.

Members for these committees were selected by drawing lots, where names written on palm leaf tickets were placed in a pot, and a young boy drew them out.\n4. **Detail Sabha Membership Requirements (Chola):** The Uttaramerur inscription also lays down strict criteria for `sabha` membership: prospective members had to be owners of land from which revenue was collected, possess their own homes, be between 35 and 70 years of age, have knowledge of the Vedas, be well-versed in administrative matters, and be honest. Disqualifications included having served on any committee in the last three years or failing to submit accounts (for themselves or relatives).\n\nAnswer: During the Pallava period, the local assemblies included the `sabha` (for brahmin landowners), the `ur` (for non-brahmin landowners), and the `nagaram` (for merchants). In the Chola period, `ur` referred to peasant settlements, and groups of these formed `nadu` which performed administrative functions. `Nagarams` were associations of traders that also performed administrative roles. The Chola `sabha` was an assembly of prominent Brahmana landholders, particularly overseeing `brahmadeya` lands.\n\nThe Chola `sabha` was highly organized, operating through separate subcommittees responsible for areas like irrigation works, gardens, and temples. Members for these committees were chosen by drawing lots from palm leaf tickets. Eligibility for `sabha` membership required individuals to be landowners paying land revenue, own their homes, be between 35 and 70 years old, possess knowledge of the Vedas, be proficient in administrative matters, and be honest. Disqualifications included having served on a committee in the preceding three years or failing to submit personal or familial accounts."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.11.9", "7.2.5", "7.7.4", "7.3.1", "7.8.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

People stopped living in many of the cities. Writing, seals and weights were no longer used. Raw materials brought from long distances became rare. In Mohenjodaro, we find that garbage piled up on the streets, the drainage system broke down, and new, less impressive houses were built, even over the streets. \nWhy did all this happen? We are not sure. Some scholars suggest that the rivers dried up. Others suggest that there was deforestation. This could have happened because fuel was required for baking bricks, and for smelting copper ores. Besides, grazing by large herds of cattle, sheep and goat may have destroyed the green cover. In some areas there were floods. But none of these reasons can explain the end of all the cities. Flooding, or a river drying up would have had an effect in only some areas. \nIt appears as if the rulers lost control. In any case, the effects of the change are quite clear. Sites in Sind and west Punjab (present-day Pakistan) were abandoned, while many people moved into newer, smaller settlements to the east and the south. \nNew cities emerged about 1400 years later. You will read about them in Chapters 6 and 9. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs traders journeyed to distant lands in caravans and ships, pilgrims often travelled with them. Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found some of the things hunter-gatherers made and used. It is likely that people made and used tools of stone, wood and bone, of which stone tools have survived best. \nSome of these stone tools were used to cut meat and bone, scrape bark (from trees) and hides (animal skins), chop fruit and roots. Some may have been attached to handles of bone or wood, to make spears and arrows for hunting. Other tools were used to chop wood, which was used as firewood. Wood was also used to make huts and tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what was the significance of Kanchipuram, and which Chinese Buddhist pilgrim was approximately contemporary with the ruling dynasties associated with this city?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Significance of Kanchipuram:** The third text section explicitly states that Kanchipuram was 'the capital' of the Pallavas. It further highlights its importance by mentioning that when the Chalukya ruler Pulakeshin II attacked the Pallava king, the king 'took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram,' indicating its role as a key, fortified city for the Pallava dynasty.\n2. **Contemporary Pilgrim:** The third section describes the Pallavas and Chalukyas as 'the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period.' The first text section identifies Xuan Zang as a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim 'who came around 1400 years ago.' By correlating these timeframes, Xuan Zang would be approximately contemporary with the Pallava dynasty and the city of Kanchipuram.\n\nAnswer: Kanchipuram was the capital of the Pallava dynasty, serving as an important and fortified city where the Pallava king sought refuge during an attack by Pulakeshin II. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuan Zang, who came around 1400 years ago, was approximately contemporary with the ruling dynasties associated with Kanchipuram."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.5", "6.2.2", "6.11.6", "6.4.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations. They were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe iron pillar at Mehrauli, Delhi, is a remarkable example of the skill of Indian crafts persons. It is made of iron, 7.2. m high, and weighs over 3 tonnes. It was made about 1500 years ago. We know the date because there is an inscription on the pillar mentioning a ruler named Chandra, who probably belonged to the Gupta dynasty (Chapter 11). What is amazing is the fact that the pillar has not rusted in all these years. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What was the Rowlatt Act, and how did Rabindranath Tagore express his pain and anger following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, specifically referencing an honour defined in the text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed.

Several battles were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda Bahadur\u2019s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. \nUnder a number of able leaders in the eighteenth century, the Sikhs organized themselves into a number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. Their combined forces were known as the grand army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as \u201cresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)\u201d. A system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. \nGuru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega khalsa). Their well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the same inscription as the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur. \nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were divided under different rulers. One of them, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and established his capital at Lahore in 1799. \nTowards the end of the 17th century a powerful state started emerging in the Deccan under the leadership of Shivaji which finally led to the establishment of the Maratha state. Shivaji was born to Shahji and Jija Bai at Shivneri in 1630. Under the guidance of his mother and his guardian Dada Konddev, Shivaji embarked on a career of conquest at a young age. The occupation of Javli made him the undisputed leader of the Mavala highlands which paved the way for further expansion. His exploits against the forces of Bijapur and the Mughals made him a legendary figure. He often resorted to guerrilla warfare against his opponents. By introducing an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi he laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state. \nThe Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasantpastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji\u2019s death, effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji\u2019s successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom. \nBaji Rao I, also known as Baji Rao Ballal was the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath. He was a great Maratha general who is credited to have expanded the Maratha kingdom beyond the Vindhyas and is known for his military campaigns against Malwa, Bundelkhand, Gujarat and the Portugese. \nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very successful military organisation. Their success lay in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed. \nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region. \nChauth : 25 per cent of the land revenue claimed by zamindars. In the Deccan this was collected by the Marathas. Sardeshmukhi : 9-10 per cent of the land revenue paid to the head revenue collector in the Deccan. \nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south (see Map 1). These were not formally included in the Maratha empire, but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, but it came at a price. These military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well. Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under Sindhia\u2019s patronage and Indore under Holkar\u2019s. By all accounts these cities were large and prosperous and functioned as important commercial and cultural centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and Allahabad in the east. \nLike the other states the Jats consolidated their power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra. \nThe power of the Jats reached its zenith under Suraj Mal who consolidated the Jat state at Bharatpur (in present day Rajasthan) during 1756-1763. The areas under the political control of Suraj Mal broadly included parts of modern eastern Rajasthan, southern Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Suraj Mal built a number of forts and palaces and the famous Lohagarh fort in Bharatpur is regarded as one of the strongest forts built in this region. \nThe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, many of the city\u2019s notables took refuge there. His son Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to fight the Mughals. \nWhile the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first associated with royalty under Shah Jahan (see Figure 12 in Chapter 5 and Figure 12 in Chapter 9). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What methods did the Sikhs and Marathas employ to assert their sovereign rule and what were the distinct administrative or military strategies that contributed to the growth of their respective states?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer the question, I will first identify the methods used by the Sikhs to assert their sovereign rule, then detail their administrative and military strategies.

Their \"well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali.\"\n3.  **Marathas' assertion of sovereign rule:** The text indicates that by the 1730s, \"the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region.\" Furthermore, territories expanded into paid \"tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty,\" even if not formally included in the empire.\n4.  **Marathas' administrative and military strategies:** Shivaji laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state by introducing \"an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi.\" The \"peasant-pastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army.\" Under the Peshwas, they developed a \"very successful military organisation\" by \"bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed.\" Administratively, once rule was secure, \"revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account,\" and \"Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived.\"\n\nAnswer: The Sikhs asserted their sovereign rule by striking coins in the names of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, initially under Banda Bahadur and again in 1765. Their state-building strategies included organizing into bands called jathas and misls, forming a grand army (dal khalsa), making collective decisions (gurmatas), and implementing the 'rakhi' system for tax collection and protection. The Marathas, on the other hand, asserted sovereignty through their king being recognized as the overlord of the Deccan peninsula, possessing the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi, and by making other regions pay tribute. Their strategies included Shivaji's efficient administrative system based on chauth and sardeshmukhi, utilizing peasant-pastoralists (kunbis) as the army's backbone, and developing a military organization that bypassed fortified areas, raided cities, and disrupted Mughal supply lines. Under the Peshwas, they also encouraged agriculture, revived trade, and developed an effective administrative system that adapted revenue demands to local conditions."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.10.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

People said he had miraculous powers \u2013 he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve all their problems. \nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas \u2013 a tribal group that lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region \u2013 Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be in danger. \nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? Who were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter. You have read about tribal societies last year. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nOrdinary people also told stories, composed poems and songs, sang, danced, and performed plays.

Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWith the decline in the authority of the Mughal emperors, the governors of large provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars consolidated their authority in different parts of the subcontinent. Through the eighteenth century, the Mughal Empire gradually fragmented into a number of independent, regional states. Broadly speaking the states of the eighteenth century can be divided into three overlapping groups: (1) States that were old Mughal provinces like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. Although extremely powerful and quite independent, the rulers of these states did not break their formal ties with the Mughal emperor. (2) States that had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals as watan jagirs. These included several Rajput principalities. (3) The last group included states under the control of Marathas, Sikhs and others like the Jats. These were of differing sizes and had seized their independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the methods of political consolidation and expansion employed by Ashoka, the Sangam chiefs, and the successor states of the Mughal Empire, based on the provided texts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Ashoka's Method:** The text states Ashoka fought a war to conquer Kalinga. However, after witnessing the violence, he decided not to fight any more wars, becoming 'the only king in the history of the world who gave up conquest after winning a war.' This indicates an initial method of military expansion followed by a unique renunciation of further conquest. \n2. **Sangam Chiefs' Method:** The text describes the muvendar (Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas) as chiefs who controlled fertile river valleys and coasts. They consolidated power and wealth by 'demanded and received gifts from the people' and by going on 'military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas.' They maintained power by distributing wealth among supporters. \n3. **Mughal Successor States' Methods:** The text explains that with the decline of Mughal authority, 'governors of large provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars consolidated their authority.' The Mughal Empire 'fragmented into a number of independent, regional states.' These states employed different methods: \n    *   Old Mughal provinces (e.g., Awadh, Bengal, Hyderabad) became powerful and independent but 'did not break their formal ties with the Mughal emperor.' \n    *   Watan jagirs (e.g., Rajput principalities) 'had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals.' \n    *   Other states (e.g., Marathas, Sikhs, Jats) 'had seized their independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle.' \nBy comparing these points, the answer will highlight the different strategies for acquiring, maintaining, and relinquishing power.\n\nAnswer: Ashoka initially expanded his empire through military conquest, as demonstrated by his war against Kalinga. However, uniquely, he chose to abandon further conquest after witnessing the bloodshed, making him the only king to do so after a victory. In contrast, the Sangam chiefs (Cholas, Cheras, Pandyas) consolidated their power and wealth by controlling fertile river valleys and coasts, demanding gifts from their populace, and collecting tribute through military expeditions against neighboring regions. They maintained their authority by distributing collected wealth among their supporters. The successor states of the Mughal Empire consolidated power through varied means following the empire's fragmentation. Some, like the rulers of Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad, were powerful governors of old Mughal provinces who became independent but retained formal ties with the emperor. Others, such as various Rajput principalities, had already enjoyed significant independence as watan jagirs under the Mughals. A third group, including the Marathas, Sikhs, and Jats, seized their independence from the Mughals after prolonged armed struggles."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.6", "6.2.11", "7.10.3", "6.10.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries?

The authors of tawarikh were learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. \nThe circle of justice - Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century: A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king promotes justice and honest governance. \nKeep the following additional details in mind: (1) the authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. (3) These authors advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared by everybody. \nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmish\u2019s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. She was removed from the throne in 1240. \nBirthright - Privileges claimed on account of birth. For example, people believed that nobles inherited their rights to govern, because they were born in certain families. Gender distinctions - Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women. \nWhat Minhaj-i Siraj thought about Raziyya? Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore asked: \u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi (1262- 1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in Kashmir (980- 1003). Her title is interesting: it comes from \u201cdidi\u201d or \u201celder sister\u201d, an obviously affectionate term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were Minhaj-i Siraj's concerns about Raziyya's rule, and how did his views reflect the concept of 'gender distinctions' as defined in the text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that Minhaj-i Siraj, the chronicler, 'recognised that she [Raziyya] was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler.' This indicates his primary concern was her gender, despite her capabilities. The text further explains his reasoning: 'Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men.' He even posed a rhetorical question: '\u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d' This clearly shows his belief in a divinely ordained hierarchy where men were superior. The text defines 'Gender distinctions' as 'Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women.' Minhaj-i Siraj's discomfort with a female ruler and his belief in women's subordination directly align with this definition, as his views used gender to argue against Raziyya's right to rule, thus asserting male superiority.\n\nAnswer: Minhaj-i Siraj recognized Raziyya's superior ability but was uncomfortable with her rule, believing it contradicted the ideal social order created by God, where women were subordinate to men. His views, which questioned how a woman could effectively rule, directly reflected the concept of 'gender distinctions' by using social and biological differences to argue for male superiority in governance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Nation, Sixty Years On \n\n On 15 August 2007, India celebrated sixty years of its existence as a free nation. How well has the country done in this time? And to what extent has it fulfilled the ideals set out in its Constitution? \nThat India is still united, and that it is still democratic, are achievements that we might justly be proud of. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country, that it would break up into many parts, with each region or linguistic group seeking to form a nation of its own. Others believed that it would come under military rule. However, as many as thirteen general elections have been held since Independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections. There is a free press, as well as an independent judiciary.Finally, the fact that people speak different languages or practise different faiths has not come in the way of national unity. \nOn the other hand, deep divisions persist. Despite constitutional guarantees, the Untouchables or, as they are now referred to, the Dalits, face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks and otherpublic places. And despite the secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution, there have been clashes between different religious groups in many states. Above all, as many observers have noted, the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development. They live in large houses and dine in expensive restaurants, send their children to expensive private schools and take expensive foreign holidays. At the same time many others continue to live below the poverty line. Housed in urban slums, or living in remote villages on lands that yield little, they cannot afford to send their children to school. \nThe Constitution recognises equality before the law, but in real life some Indians are more equal than others. Judged by the standards it set itself at Independence, the Republic of India has not been a great success. But it has not been a failure either. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIn the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons. The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFind Daojali Hading on Map 2 (page14). This is a site on the hills near the Brahmaputra Valley, close to routes leading into China and Myanmar. Here stone tools, including mortars and pestles, have been found.

Also common are finds of tools made of fossil wood (ancient wood that has hardened into stone), and pottery. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently. The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the methods and challenges of territorial control and administration employed by the Mauryan Empire, the Delhi Sultanate, and the East India Company in their early stages of influence in India."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Mauryan Empire:** The text titled \"As the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently\" describes a multi-tiered administrative system. The area around Pataliputra was under direct control, managed by appointed officials for tax collection, law enforcement, and supervised by the emperor and ministers. Other provinces, like Taxila or Ujjain, were ruled from provincial capitals, often by royal princes, where local customs were likely followed, indicating a degree of decentralized control. Between these centers, the Mauryas controlled roads and rivers to collect resources as tax and tribute. Forested regions had largely independent people, expected to provide specific goods like elephants or timber. The primary challenge was managing an empire described as \"so large,\" necessitating varied administrative approaches. \n2.  **Delhi Sultanate:** The text \"In the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons.\" highlights their initial limited control, making them dependent on trade, tribute, or plunder for supplies from the hinterland. Major challenges included difficulty controlling distant regions (like Bengal and Sind), fragile communication routes vulnerable to disruption, Mongol invasions, and rebellious governors. Consolidation efforts under rulers like Ghiyasuddin Balban focused on developing the hinterlands of garrison towns, clearing forests, encouraging agriculture, and establishing new towns to protect trade. Further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq involved military expeditions into southern India to capture resources and collect taxes, showing a shift towards broader territorial assertion, though the text questions \"how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory?\"\n3.  **East India Company:** The sections detailing \"How trade led to battles\" and \"The Battle of Plassey\" show the Company's initial method of influence was to secure trade concessions through local rulers. After the Battle of Plassey, they aimed for \"puppet rulers\" like Mir Jafar to grant privileges. However, this strategy faced challenges as these puppet nawabs were \"not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be,\" needing to maintain dignity and sovereignty, leading to protests and their replacement (e.g., Mir Qasim). The Company also needed increasing revenue to finance its wars and trade demands, which puppet rulers could not consistently provide. This led to Clive's declaration, \"We must indeed become nawabs ourselves,\" culminating in the Company being appointed Diwan of Bengal in 1785. This granted them direct control over vast revenue resources, enabling them to finance their expenses, troops, and infrastructure directly from Indian revenues, marking a shift from indirect control through puppets to direct administrative authority.\n4.  **Contrast:** The Mauryan Empire managed its vast territory through a structured, multi-tiered system with varying degrees of direct and indirect control, adapting to regional characteristics. The Delhi Sultanate initially struggled with limited direct control and external threats, gradually expanding through military consolidation and developing hinterlands, though questions about the effectiveness of their widespread control remained. The East India Company, starting as a trading entity, initially attempted to exert influence through pliable local rulers but found this unsustainable due to the rulers' resistance and its own growing financial needs, ultimately leading to the direct assumption of administrative and revenue collection powers (Diwani). While all three sought to control and extract resources, their methods evolved distinctly based on their nature (established empire vs. emerging sultanate vs. trading company) and the specific historical context and challenges they faced.\n\nAnswer: The Mauryan Empire administered its vast territory through a tiered system: direct imperial control in core areas like Pataliputra, provincial capitals with royal princes governing while respecting local customs, and control over inter-center regions via transport routes for tax/tribute, with forested areas being largely independent but providing specific resources. The Delhi Sultanate initially had limited control beyond fortified garrison towns, struggling with distant regions, communication, Mongol invasions, and rebellious governors; it later consolidated power by developing hinterlands and expanding through military expeditions, though questions about the effectiveness of its widespread control persisted. The East India Company, in its early influence, initially sought to expand trade through compliant 'puppet rulers' who would grant concessions. However, the Company faced challenges as these rulers resisted, and its increasing financial needs for wars and trade could not be met by the puppets, leading the Company to eventually assume direct administrative and revenue collection powers (Diwani) in Bengal."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.10.6", "8.2.2", "7.3.3", "6.8.3", "6.3.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India.

Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement.

(2) States that had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals as watan jagirs. These included several Rajput principalities.

As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms.

Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe lions that we see on our notes and coins have a long history. They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\n1 How, When and Where\n\nHow Important are Dates?\nThere was a time when historians were fascinated with dates. There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nMost of Egypt is a dry desert, except for the lands along the river Nile \nAround 5000 years ago, kings ruled over Egypt. These kings sent armies to distant lands to get gold, silver, ivory, timber, and precious stones. They also built huge tombs, known as pyramids. \nWhen they died, the bodies of kings were preserved and buried in these pyramids. These carefully preserved bodies are known as \u2018mummies\u2019. A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Explain the progression of social hierarchy in ancient India as described in the texts, from the Varna system to Jatis, including how different groups were integrated or resisted these structures."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought begins by identifying the initial social organization from the 'Later Vedic Period society' text, which describes the four-fold Varna system (brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra) based on birth, their functions, and the exclusion of women and shudras from studying the Vedas, as well as the classification of 'untouchables'. Next, it moves to the 'As the economy and the needs of society grew...' text to describe the evolution where smaller castes, or 'jatis', emerged within varnas and eventually became the primary basis for organizing society. This section also explains how new groups, such as tribes, were integrated into the caste system, with leading tribal families becoming part of the ruling class (like Rajput clans) and others forming lower jatis. Finally, the reasoning identifies instances of resistance or alternative structures from both texts: the 'Later Vedic Period society' text mentions that many people, including some kings, did not accept the varna system, challenged birth as the basis, and condemned untouchability, noting areas with limited priestly influence. The 'As the economy and the needs of society grew...' text highlights that some dominant tribes, particularly in Punjab, Sind, and the North-West Frontier, adopted Islam and actively rejected the caste system.\n\nAnswer: In ancient India, social hierarchy initially revolved around the Varna system during the Later Vedic Period, where society was divided into four varnas\u2014brahmins, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and shudras\u2014based on birth, each with prescribed functions. Women were often grouped with shudras, and neither could study the Vedas; later, 'untouchables' were also classified. Over time, as the economy and societal needs grew, smaller castes or 'jatis' emerged within these varnas and gradually became the primary basis for social organization. Many tribes and social groups were integrated into this caste-based society, with leading tribal families joining the ruling class (like the Rajput clans) and a large majority forming lower jatis. However, there was significant resistance to these structures; during the Later Vedic Period, many people, including some kings, did not accept the varna system, challenged birth as its basis, and condemned untouchability. Furthermore, in later periods, dominant tribes in regions like Punjab, Sind, and the North-West Frontier adopted Islam and actively rejected the caste system, indicating that the unequal social order was not universally accepted."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.1", "8.1.1", "6.4.11", "6.6.2", "7.7.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nPrashastis contain details that may not be literally true. But they tell us how rulers wanted to depict themselves \u2013 as valiant, victorious warriors, for example. These were composed by learned Brahmanas, who occasionally helped in the administration. Kings often rewarded Brahmanas by grants of land. These were recorded on copper plates, which were given to those who received the land. \nMany rulers described their achievements in prashastis (you read about the prashasti of the Gupta ruler Samudragupta last year). One prashasti, written in Sanskrit and found in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, describes the exploits of Nagabhata, a Pratihara king, as follows: The kings of Andhra, Saindhava (Sind), Vidarbha (part of Maharashtra) and Kalinga (part of Orissa) fell before him even as he was a prince \u2026 He won a victory over Chakrayudha (the ruler of Kanauj) \u2026 He defeated the king of Vanga (part of Bengal), Anarta (part of Gujarat), Malava (part of Madhya Pradesh), Kirata (forest peoples), Turushka (Turks), Vatsa, Matsya (both kingdoms in north India) \nWhat was given with the land? This is part of the Tamil section of a land grant given by the Cholas: We have demarcated the boundaries of the land by making earthen embankments, as well as by planting thorny bushes. This is what the land contains: fruit-bearing trees, water, land, gardens and orchards, trees, wells, open spaces, pastureland, a village, anthills, platforms, canals, ditches, rivers, silt-laden land, tanks, granaries, fish ponds, bee hives, and deep lakes. He who receives the land can collect taxes from it. He can collect the taxes imposed by judicial officers as fines, the tax on betel-leaves, that on woven cloth, as well as on vehicles. He can build large rooms, with upper stories made of baked bricks, he can get large and small wells dug, he can plant trees and thorny bushes, if necessary, he can get canals constructed for irrigation. He should ensure that water is not wasted, and that embankments are built. \nUnusual for the twelfth century was a long Sanskrit poem containing the history of kings who ruled over Kashmir. It was composed by an author named Kalhana. He used a variety of sources, including inscriptions, documents, eyewitness accounts and earlier histories, to write his account. Unlike the writers of prashastis, he was often critical about rulers and their policies. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nSome of the earliest works in Tamil, known as Sangam literature, were composed around 2300 years ago. These texts were called Sangam because they were supposed to have been composed and compiled in assemblies (known as sangams) of poets that were held in the city of Madurai (see Map 7, page 113). The Tamil terms mentioned above are found in Sangam literature. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What was a brahmadeya during the Chola period, how was it administered, and what were the typical rights and responsibilities associated with receiving such a land grant?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text defines 'brahmadeya' as 'land gifted to Brahmanas'.

The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor- General (1798-1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. \nTipu Sultan \u2013 The \u201cTiger of Mysore\u201d The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. \nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1781 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close relationship with the French in India, and modernised his army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious, arrogant and dangerous \u2013 rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1787-89, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \nWar with the Marathas \n From the late eighteenth century the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1781, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy \n It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, carried on the resistance. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book. \nIn the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab was annexed. \nThe Doctrine of Lapse \n The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1858. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1858, the Company also took over Awadh. This time the British had an added argument \u2013 they said they were \u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nBC, we have seen stands for Before Christ.

And sometimes, the letters BP meaning Before Present are used. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIndian Textiles and the World Market \n\n Let us first look at textile production. Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's acquisition of political power in India, as described through its expansion methods, alter its financial strategy for purchasing Indian textiles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The 'Company Rule Expands' section details how the East India Company used various political, economic, and diplomatic methods, including direct military attacks and subsidiary alliances, to expand its influence and annex Indian states, thereby gaining political power.

They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHow Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives? \n\n The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n\u201cIt takes a loud voice to make the deaf hear. Inquilab Zindabad !\u201d \n Revolutionary nationalists such as Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Sukhdev and others wanted to fight against the colonial rule and the rich exploiting classes through a revolution of workers and peasants. For this purpose they founded the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928 at Ferozeshah Kotla in Delhi. On 17 December, 1928, Bhagat Singh, Azad and Rajguru assassinated Saunders, a police officer who was involved in the lathi-charge that had caused the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. \nOn 8 April, 1929, Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly. The aim, as their leaflet explained, was not to kill but \u201cto make the deaf hear\u201d, and to remind the foreign government of its callous exploitation. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were executed on March 23, 1931. Bhagat Singh\u2019s age at that time was only 23. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, how did British colonial rule specifically impact the authority of tribal chiefs, the practices of shifting cultivators, and the lives of people dependent on forests?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Tribal Chiefs:** The text states that before British rule, tribal chiefs had economic power and the right to administer their territories. Under British rule, they were allowed to keep land titles but lost much of their administrative power, were forced to follow British laws, pay tribute, and discipline their own people on behalf of the British, thus losing their traditional authority. (Section: 'How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?', Subsection: 'What happened to tribal chiefs?')\n2. **Shifting Cultivators:** The British sought to make shifting cultivators settle down to facilitate control and revenue collection, introducing land settlements. However, this was largely unsuccessful, especially in areas with scarce water and dry soil, leading to poor yields for jhum cultivators. Due to widespread protests, particularly in north-east India, the British eventually permitted them to continue shifting cultivation in certain forest areas. (Section: 'How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?', Subsection: 'What happened to the shifting cultivators?')\n3. **People Dependent on Forests:** The British declared all forests as state property, classifying some as 'Reserved Forests' for timber, where tribal people were forbidden to move freely, practice jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt. This forced many to seek work elsewhere. To secure labor for logging, the British established 'forest villages,' granting jhum cultivators small plots of land on the condition that they provide labor to the Forest Department. These changes led to rebellions. (Section: 'How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?', Subsection: 'Forest laws and their impact')\n\nAnswer: British colonial rule significantly altered tribal lives: Tribal chiefs lost most of their administrative power, being forced to follow British laws, pay tribute, and manage their people on behalf of the British, despite retaining land titles. Shifting cultivators were pressured to settle down, with land settlements introduced, but faced difficulties and resisted, leading the British to eventually allow shifting cultivation in some areas. For people dependent on forests, the British declared forests state property, restricting traditional activities like jhum cultivation, fruit collection, and hunting in 'Reserved Forests,' and creating 'forest villages' to ensure a supply of cheap labor for the Forest Department."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.1", "8.4.3", "8.9.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Magadha became the most important mahajanapada in about two hundred years. Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies (c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest, could be captured and trained for the army. Forests also provided wood for building houses, carts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore mines in the region that could be tapped to make strong tools and weapons. \nMagadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible means to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma Nanda was another important ruler. He extended his control up to the north-west part of the subcontinent. Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in Bihar was the capital of Magadha for several years.

Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement.

Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What key geographical and resource-based advantages contributed to Magadha's importance, and how did the perception of Indian armies, potentially drawing on such resources, influence Alexander's decision to halt his eastward advance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text identifies several advantages for Magadha.

Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary sources of wealth or economic activity for the powerful chiefs of South India and for the different tribal groups described in the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. First, I will identify the sources of wealth for the powerful chiefs of South India from the first text section. The text states that these chiefs \"did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas.\"\n2. Next, I will identify the economic activities and sources of livelihood for the various tribal groups from the second text section.\n3. The text describes several tribal groups: \"Some were jhum cultivators\" who practised shifting cultivation to grow crops. \"Some were hunters and gatherers\" who lived by \"hunting animals and gathering forest produce,\" which they sometimes sold or exchanged for other goods, or by doing \"odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads,\" or by \"laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers.\" \"Some herded animals,\" acting as \"pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons.\" Finally, \"Some took to settled cultivation,\" cultivating \"their fields in one place year after year\" and using the plough.\n4. Additionally, the text notes that tribal groups often faced economic challenges due to their \"dependence on traders and moneylenders,\" who \"sold the goods at high prices\" and gave loans with \"very high\" interest, leading to \"debt and poverty.\"\n5. By comparing these points, the differing economic models become clear: chiefs relied on demands, gifts, and tribute from power, while tribal groups engaged in various forms of subsistence and labor-based activities, often facing exploitative external economic pressures.\n\nAnswer: The powerful chiefs of South India acquired wealth primarily by demanding and receiving gifts from the people and by collecting tribute from neighbouring areas through military expeditions. The different tribal groups, however, engaged in diverse economic activities such as jhum (shifting) cultivation, hunting and gathering forest produce, herding animals as pastoralists, and settled cultivation. Many also earned by doing odd jobs or laboring in fields, though they often experienced debt and poverty due to high prices from traders and high interest from moneylenders."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.2", "8.4.2", "6.12.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This is one of the oldest cities in Europe, and developed around the same time as the cities in the Ganga valley. Rome was the capital of one of the largest empires \u2014 one that spread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Augustus, one of the most important emperors, who ruled about 2000 years ago, said that he found Rome a city of brick, and made it into a city of marble. He, and later rulers, built temples and palaces. \nThey also built huge amphitheatres \u2014 open arenas surrounded by tiers of seats \u2014 where citizens could watch all kinds of shows, and public baths (with separate timings for men and women), where people met and relaxed. Huge aqueducts \u2014 channels to supply water \u2014 were built to bring water to the city \u2014 for the baths, fountains and toilets. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThere are several things we can find out \u2014 what people ate, the kinds of clothes they wore, the houses in which they lived.

We can also find out about the games children played, the stories they heard, the plays they saw, the songs they sang. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study \n Much before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at a place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country. \nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of Odisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and 1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no inclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Odisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817. \nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures. It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of shortterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case of natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal. \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these grievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of making salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape. \nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took away a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions with Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started. The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The priests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support. \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha. Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi jagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed, many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by May 1817 the uprising was mostly contained. \nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May 1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and forbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary reforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \n In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had far reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To merely call it a \u2018Paik Rebellion\u2019 will thus be an understatement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what types of public and religious structures were characteristic of ancient Rome and ancient India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes structures built in ancient Rome in the section titled 'Find Rome on Map 6'.

In the early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti noted: \u201che removed all the valuables ... The statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace ... and the golden images in the various monasteries \u2013 all these he seized.\u201d The blow to the pride of the Sinhalese ruler had to be avenged and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered his general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. The Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha. \nSimilarly in the early eleventh century, when the Chola king Rajendra I built a Shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated rulers. An incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas; an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the Palas of Bengal. \nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of Rajendra I. During his campaigns in the subcontinent he attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols. Sultan Mahmud was not a very important ruler at that time. But by destroying temples \u2013 especially the one at Somnath \u2013 he tried to win credit as a great hero of Islam. In the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMany Rajput rulers had accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals but Mewar was the only Rajput state which defied Mughal authority. Rana Pratap ascended the throne at Mewar in 1572, with Udaipur and large part of Mewar under his control. A series of envoys were sent to the Rana to persuade him to accept Mughal suzerainty, but he stood his ground. \nMany Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional politics at the Mughal court. \nThese influential Rajput families claimed the subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa. Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial territories neighbouring their watans. Nagaur was conquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, while Amber seized large portions of Bundi. Sawai Raja Jai Singh founded his new capital at Jaipur and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe pressure on these principalities and checked their further expansion. \nMany Rajput chieftains built a number of forts on hill tops which became centres of power. With extensive fortifications, these majestic structures housed urban centres, palaces, temples, trading centres, water harvesting structures and other buildings. The Chittorgarh fort contained many water bodies varying from talabs (ponds) to kundis (wells), baolis (stepwells), etc. \nA description of Raja Jai Singh in a Persian account of 1732: Raja Jai Singh was at the height of his power. He was the governor of Agra for 12 years and of Malwa for 5 or 6 years. He possessed a large army, artillery and great wealth. His sway extended from Delhi to the banks of the Narmada. \nSawai Jai Singh, the ruler of Amber constructed five astronomical observatories, one each in Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, Mathura and Varanasi. Commonly known as Jantar Mantar, these observatories had various instruments to study heavenly bodies. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nRuling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent with such a diversity of people and cultures was an extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplish in the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the strategies employed by Rajput rulers who accepted Mughal suzerainty to expand their influence and territories, and what benefits they received from their association with the Mughal Empire."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that many Rajput rulers, specifically those from Amber and Jodhpur, accepted Mughal suzerainty, unlike Mewar. In exchange for serving under the Mughals with distinction, they were granted considerable autonomy in their 'watan jagirs'. The text then details their strategies for expansion in the eighteenth century:\n1.  **Extending Control:** They attempted to extend their control over adjacent regions.\n2.  **Gaining Governorships (Subadari):** Influential Rajput families claimed and held governorships of rich provinces like Gujarat and Malwa. For instance, Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur was governor of Gujarat, and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by Emperor Jahandar Shah.\n3.  **Seizing Imperial Territories:** They expanded their territories by seizing parts of imperial lands neighboring their watans, such as Nagaur being annexed by Jodhpur and large portions of Bundi by Amber.\n4.  **Founding New Capitals and Receiving Additional Subadari:** Sawai Raja Jai Singh founded Jaipur and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. The text also mentions his extensive power, governing Agra for 12 years and Malwa for 5 or 6 years, possessing a large army, artillery, and wealth, with sway from Delhi to the Narmada.\n5.  **Building Forts:** Rajput chieftains also built numerous forts on hilltops, which became centers of power and housed urban centers, palaces, and trading centers.\nHowever, their expansion was eventually checked by Maratha campaigns from the 1740s. These points directly answer the question about their strategies and benefits.\n\nAnswer: Rajput rulers who accepted Mughal suzerainty, such as those from Amber and Jodhpur, gained considerable autonomy in their 'watan jagirs' in exchange for serving the Mughals with distinction. In the eighteenth century, they employed several strategies to expand their influence and territories:\n1.  They extended control over adjacent regions.\n2.  They claimed and held the subadari (governorship) of rich provinces like Gujarat and Malwa; for example, Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur governed Gujarat, and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber governed Malwa.\n3.  They expanded their territories by seizing portions of imperial lands neighboring their watans, such as Nagaur being annexed by Jodhpur and large parts of Bundi by Amber.\n4.  Sawai Raja Jai Singh founded a new capital at Jaipur and was granted the subadari of Agra in 1722, demonstrating his accumulated power and influence.\n5.  Many Rajput chieftains also built forts on hilltops, which served as centers of power, housing urban centers, palaces, temples, and trading centers.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nUsually two to three generations live together in small settlements or villages. Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together. There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n\u201cIt takes a loud voice to make the deaf hear. Inquilab Zindabad !\u201d \n Revolutionary nationalists such as Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Sukhdev and others wanted to fight against the colonial rule and the rich exploiting classes through a revolution of workers and peasants. For this purpose they founded the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928 at Ferozeshah Kotla in Delhi. On 17 December, 1928, Bhagat Singh, Azad and Rajguru assassinated Saunders, a police officer who was involved in the lathi-charge that had caused the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. \nOn 8 April, 1929, Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Legislative Assembly. The aim, as their leaflet explained, was not to kill but \u201cto make the deaf hear\u201d, and to remind the foreign government of its callous exploitation. Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were executed on March 23, 1931. Bhagat Singh\u2019s age at that time was only 23. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nBecause kings built temples to demonstrate their devotion to God and their power and wealth, it is not surprising that when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms they often targeted these buildings. In the early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti noted: \u201che removed all the valuables ... The statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace ... and the golden images in the various monasteries \u2013 all these he seized.\u201d The blow to the pride of the Sinhalese ruler had to be avenged and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered his general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. The Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha. \nSimilarly in the early eleventh century, when the Chola king Rajendra I built a Shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated rulers. An incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas; an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the Palas of Bengal. \nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of Rajendra I. During his campaigns in the subcontinent he attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols. Sultan Mahmud was not a very important ruler at that time. But by destroying temples \u2013 especially the one at Somnath \u2013 he tried to win credit as a great hero of Islam. In the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the concept and demonstration of wealth differ between tribal societies and the medieval kingdoms described in the text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states that in tribal societies, \"land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together,\" leading to \"no sharp differences between the rich and the poor.\" This indicates a communal and shared concept of wealth.\n\nIn contrast, the second text section details how medieval kings like the Pandyan king, Chola king Rajendra I, and Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, \"built temples to demonstrate their devotion to God and their power and wealth.\" They also \"targeted these buildings\" in rival kingdoms, removing \"all the valuables\" and \"golden images\" and filling their own temples with \"prized statues seized from defeated rulers.\" This shows wealth being accumulated, displayed through grand structures and valuable artifacts, and used as a symbol of individual power and military success through looting.\n\nAnswer: In tribal societies, wealth was conceptualized as communal resources like land, forests, grasslands, and water, which were shared by the entire tribe, resulting in minimal differences between the rich and the poor. Conversely, medieval kings demonstrated wealth by building grand temples, which served as displays of their devotion, power, and personal wealth. They also accumulated and showcased wealth by looting valuables, including gold statues and idols, from the temples of defeated rulers."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.8", "7.5.4", "8.9.3", "8.5.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently. The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nOstriches were found in India during the Palaeolithic period.

Men, women and children probably observed several things: the places where edible plants were found, how seeds broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. Perhaps they began looking after plants \u2014 protecting them from birds and animals so that they could grow and the seeds could ripen. In this way people became farmers. \nWomen, men and children could also attract and then tame animals by leaving food for them near their shelters. The first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that were relatively gentle to come near the camps where they lived. These animals such as sheep, goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and most of them ate grass. Often, people protected these animals from attacks by other wild animals. This is how they became herders. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThere are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle, children (especially sons), and horses. Horses were yoked to chariots that were used in battles, which were fought to capture cattle. Battles were also fought for land, which was important for pasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened quickly, such as barley. Some battles were fought for water, and to capture people. \nSome of the wealth that was obtained was kept by the leaders, some was given to the priests and the rest was distributed amongst the people. Some wealth was used for the performance of yajnas or sacrifices in which offerings were made into the fire. These were meant for gods and goddesses. Offerings could include ghee, grain, and in some cases, animals. \nMost men took part in these wars. There was no regular army, but there were assemblies where people met and discussed matters of war and peace. They also chose leaders, who were often brave and skilful warriors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMetallurgy Ancient Indian metallurgists made major contributions to the metallurgical history of the world. Archaeological excavations have shown that the Harappans were master craftsmen and had knowledge of copper metallurgy. They even manufactured bronze by mixing copper and tin. While the Harappans belonged to the Bronze Age, their successors belonged to the Iron Age. India produced highly advanced types of iron-forged iron, wrought iron and cast iron. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIf heroic traditions can be found in different regions in different forms, the same is true of dance. Let us look at the history of one dance form, Kathak, now associated with several parts of north India. The term kathak is derived from katha, a word used in Sanskrit and other languages for story. The kathaks were originally a caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who embellished their performances with gestures and songs. Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of dance in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with the spread of the bhakti movement. The legends of Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures of the kathak story-tellers. \nUnder the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak was performed in the court, where it acquired its present features and developed into a form of dance with a distinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two traditions or gharanas: one in the courts of Rajasthan (Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow. Under the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into a major art form. By the third quarter of the nineteenth century it was firmly entrenched as a dance form not only in these two regions, but in the adjoining areas of present-day Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Emphasis was laid on intricate and rapid footwork, elaborate costumes, as well as on the enactment of stories. \nKathak, like several other cultural practices, was viewed with disfavour by most British administrators in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it survived and continued to be performed by courtesans, and was recognised as one of six \u201cclassical\u201d forms of dance in the country after independence. \nThe question of defining any art form as \u201cclassical\u201d is often quite complicated. Do we define something as classical if it deals with a religious theme? Or do we consider it classical because it appears to require a great deal of skill acquired through long years of training? Or is it classical because it is performed according to rules that are laid down, and variations are not encouraged? These are questions we need to think about. It is worth remembering that many dance forms that are classified as \u201cfolk\u201d also share several of the characteristics considered typical of \u201cclassical\u201d forms. So, while the use of the term \u201cclassical\u201d may suggest that these forms are superior, this need not always be literally true. Other dance forms that are recognised as classical at present are: Bharatanatyam (Tamil Nadu) Kathakali (Kerala) Odissi (Odisha) Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh) Manipuri (Manipur) \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nVery often, a single town was important for a variety of reasons. Let us look at the example of Mathura (Map 7, page 113). \nMathura has been an important settlement for more than 2500 years. It was important because it was located at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south. There were fortifications around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food for people in the city. Mathura was also a centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced. \nAround 2000 years ago Mathura became the second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you will be reading in Chapter 10. Mathura was also a religious centre \u2014 there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and it was an important centre for the worship of Krishna.ks \nmoSeveral inscriptions on surfaces such as stone slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to monasteries and shrines. These were made by kings and queens, officers, merchants, and crafts persons who lived in the city. For instance, inscriptions from Mathura mention goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers.ks \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were some of the diverse roles and occupations of people in ancient and historical India, and in which contexts are they mentioned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires identifying various roles and occupations from all the provided text sections.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana \u2013 or \u201ccountry inhabited by Gonds\u201d. They practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, compare the primary methods of food acquisition and resource management utilized by early hunter-gatherers with the economic strategies and resource management of the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga and the Ahom state."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first extract the methods of food acquisition and resource management for each group from the text. \n\n1.  **Hunter-gatherers:** The text states they \"hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs.\" Their resource management involved moving from place to place to prevent resource depletion, follow animal movements, find seasonal plants, and access water.\n\n2.  **Gond Kingdom of Garha Katanga:** The text mentions the Gonds \"practised shifting cultivation,\" which involved cutting and burning trees, sowing crops in ashes, and moving to new plots when fertility declined.

These paiks were \"engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works.\"\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Hunter-gatherers relied on direct foraging and hunting, managing resources through nomadic movement.\n*   The Gonds transitioned to a form of agriculture (shifting cultivation) and engaged in commercial exploitation of natural resources (elephant export).\n*   The Ahoms developed more advanced agricultural techniques (new rice cultivation methods) and implemented a centralized system of forced labor (paiks) for large-scale public works like dams and irrigation, indicating a more sophisticated and organized approach to economic strategy and resource management.\n\nAnswer: Early hunter-gatherers primarily acquired food by hunting wild animals, catching fish and birds, and gathering plant produce like fruits, roots, nuts, and eggs. Their resource management involved nomadic movement to prevent resource depletion, follow animal migration, find seasonal plants, and access water.\n\nIn contrast, the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga practiced shifting cultivation, an agricultural method involving clearing and burning land to sow crops, and earned significant wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants. The Ahom state introduced new methods of rice cultivation and managed resources through a system of forced labor where 'paiks' were conscripted by rotation from villages to build dams, irrigation systems, and other public works, indicating a more structured and advanced economic and resource management approach."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.2.1", "7.7.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAround 2500 years ago, the people of Athens set up a form of government, which was called a democracy, which lasted for about 200 years. \nAll free men over the age of 30 were recognised as full citizens. There was an assembly that met at least 40 times a year to decide on important matters. All citizens could attend these meetings. \nAppointments for many positions were made through lottery. All those who wanted to be chosen gave in their names, and then some were selected through lottery. \nCitizens were expected to serve in the army and the navy. However, women were not considered citizens. Also, many foreigners, who lived and worked in Athens as merchants and crafts persons did not have rights as citizens. \nBesides, there were several thousand slaves in Athens, who worked in mines, fields, households and workshops. They too were not treated as citizens. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe last and 24th tirthankara of the Jainas, Vardhamana Mahavira, also spread his message around this time, i.e. 2500 years ago. He was a kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha, about which you read in Chapter 6. At the age of thirty, he left home and went to live in a forest. For twelve years he led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment. \nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes. They must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings. \u201cAll beings,\u201d said Mahavira \u201clong to live. To all things life is dear.\u201d Ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers, because they used Prakrit. There were several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of the country, and named after the regions in which they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken in Magadha was known as Magadhi. \nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and were especially asked not to steal. Also, they had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up everything, including their clothes. \nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands left their homes to learn and teach this new way of life. Many more remained behind and supported those who became monks and nuns, providing them with food. \nJainism was supported mainly by traders. Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and his followers were transmitted orally for several centuries. They were written down in the form in which they are presently available at a place called Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see Map 7, page 113). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe often take the use of iron for granted today. Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools.

There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly.

These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory.

There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHindu The word \u2018Hindu\u2019, like the term \u2018India\u2019 is derived from the river Indus. It was used by Arabs and Iranians to refer to people who lived to the east of the river, and to their cultural practices, including religious beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the main criticisms or problems identified with James Mill's periodization of Indian history and the subsequent 'ancient', 'medieval', and 'modern' classification?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text first introduces James Mill's 1817 periodization of Indian history into 'Hindu', 'Muslim', and 'British' periods. The primary criticisms of Mill's approach are detailed as follows: Mill believed Asian societies were less civilised than Europe, portraying pre-British India (Hindu and Muslim periods) as being ruled by despots and dominated by religious intolerance, caste taboos, and superstitious practices. He saw British rule as a civilising force necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions, and laws, and felt India was incapable of progress without British help. The text questions the acceptance of this view, which frames British rule as progress and the preceding periods as 'darkness'. Furthermore, it criticises characterising an entire age solely by the religion of its rulers, arguing that diverse faiths coexisted and not all rulers shared the same faith, thereby ignoring the lives and practices of others.\n\nSubsequently, the text discusses the division of Indian history into 'ancient', 'medieval', and 'modern'. The main problem identified with this classification is that it is borrowed from the West. In the West, the 'modern' period is associated with progress like science, reason, democracy, liberty, and equality, while 'medieval' lacks these. The text argues that this characterisation cannot be uncritically applied to the period of British rule in India, as people did not experience equality, freedom, or liberty, nor was it a period of economic growth and progress. Due to these issues, many historians prefer to refer to this period as 'colonial'.\n\nAnswer: James Mill's periodization of Indian history into 'Hindu', 'Muslim', and 'British' was criticized for portraying pre-British India as uncivilized, ruled by despots, and dominated by religious intolerance, caste taboos, and superstitious practices, implying that British rule was necessary for India's progress. This approach was also flawed for characterising entire ages solely by the religion of their rulers, disregarding the diverse faiths and practices of the populace. The later 'ancient', 'medieval', and 'modern' classification was problematic because it was borrowed from the West, where 'modern' signified progress like science, reason, democracy, liberty, and equality. This framework did not accurately describe British rule in India, which lacked equality, freedom, liberty, and economic progress, leading many historians to label that period 'colonial' instead."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.12.7", "6.6.9", "6.10.9", "8.1.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

He was a kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha, about which you read in Chapter 6. At the age of thirty, he left home and went to live in a forest. For twelve years he led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment. \nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes. They must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings. \u201cAll beings,\u201d said Mahavira \u201clong to live. To all things life is dear.\u201d Ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers, because they used Prakrit. There were several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of the country, and named after the regions in which they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken in Magadha was known as Magadhi. \nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and were especially asked not to steal. Also, they had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up everything, including their clothes. \nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands left their homes to learn and teach this new way of life. Many more remained behind and supported those who became monks and nuns, providing them with food. \nJainism was supported mainly by traders. Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and his followers were transmitted orally for several centuries. They were written down in the form in which they are presently available at a place called Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see Map 7, page 113). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAround the time when Jainism and Buddhism were becoming popular, brahmins developed the system of ashramas. Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What similarities existed between the ascetic practices for men in Jainism and the later stages of life prescribed by the Ashrama system?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section describes Mahavira's path where he \"left home and went to live in a forest\" and led a \"hard and lonely life\" to attain enlightenment.

In the Tamil region, large landowners were known as vellalar, ordinary ploughmen were known as uzhavar, and landless labourers, including slaves, were known as kadaisiyar and adimai. \nIn the northern part of the country, the village headman was known as the grama bhojaka. Usually, men from the same family held the position for generations. In other words, the post was hereditary. The grama bhojaka was often the largest landowner. Generally, he had slaves and hired workers to cultivate the land. Besides, as he was powerful, the king often used him to collect taxes from the village. He also functioned as a judge, and sometimes as a policeman. \nApart from the gramabhojaka, there were other independent farmers, known as grihapatis, most of whom were smaller landowners. And then there were men and women such as the dasa karmakara, who did not own land, and had to earn a living working on the fields owned by others. \nIn most villages there were also some crafts persons such as the blacksmith, potter, carpenter and weaver. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nDid you notice the title of this book, Our Pasts? We have used the word \u2018pasts\u2019 in plural to draw attention to the fact that the past was different for different groups of people. For example, the lives of herders or farmers were different from those of kings and queens, the lives of merchants were different from those of crafts persons, and so on. Also, as is true even today, people followed different practices and customs in different parts  of the country. For example, today most people living in the Andaman Islands get their own food by fishing, hunting, and collecting forest produce. By contrast, most people living in cities depend on others for supplies of food. Differences such as these existed in the past as well. \nBesides, there is another kind of difference. We know a great deal about kings and the battles they fought because they kept records of their victories. Generally, ordinary people such as hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers or herders did not keep records of what they did. While archaeology helps us to find out about their lives, there is much that remains unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nVery often, a single town was important for a variety of reasons. Let us look at the example of Mathura (Map 7, page 113). \nMathura has been an important settlement for more than 2500 years. It was important because it was located at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south. There were fortifications around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food for people in the city. Mathura was also a centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced. \nAround 2000 years ago Mathura became the second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you will be reading in Chapter 10. Mathura was also a religious centre \u2014 there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and it was an important centre for the worship of Krishna.ks \nmoSeveral inscriptions on surfaces such as stone slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to monasteries and shrines. These were made by kings and queens, officers, merchants, and crafts persons who lived in the city. For instance, inscriptions from Mathura mention goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers.ks \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUsually two to three generations live together in small settlements or villages. Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together. There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did the lives and societal roles of different groups of people vary in the past, and what implications did this have for historical records?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Initial Premise (Section 1):** The introductory text 'Our Pasts' establishes that the past was different for various groups of people (e.g., herders/farmers vs. kings/queens, merchants vs. crafts persons). It also explicitly states that kings kept records, while ordinary people (hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers, herders) generally did not, making much about their lives unknown. \n2.  **Village Structures (Section 4):** This section details hierarchical social structures in villages. In the Tamil region, there were large landowners (vellalar), ordinary ploughmen (uzhavar), and landless labourers/slaves (kadaisiyar and adimai). In the northern part, the grama bhojaka held a powerful, hereditary position as the largest landowner, tax collector, judge, and policeman, often using slaves and hired workers. Other groups included independent smaller landowners (grihapatis) and landless labourers (dasa karmakara), as well as various crafts persons (blacksmith, potter, carpenter, weaver).\n3.  **Tribal Societies (Section 3):** Tribes presented a contrasting social structure where land, forests, grasslands, and water were communal wealth, shared by all, leading to no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. Members engaged in occupations like hunting, gathering, farming, herding, and fishing, with specific roles for men (leading large herds), women (most agricultural work, threshing, grinding), and children (looking after plants/small flocks). Both men and women participated in crafts and animal care.\n4.  **Urban Life in Mathura (Section 2):** Mathura, an important urban settlement, supported a diverse population including farmers and herders from surrounding areas who provided food. The city was a center for fine sculpture and home to various crafts persons (e.g., goldsmiths, blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland makers, perfumers), merchants, officers, kings, and queens. Inscriptions record gifts made by these diverse city dwellers.\n5.  **Implications for Historical Records (Synthesizing with Section 1):** The varying social roles directly impacted what is known historically. As stated in Section 1, kings and queens (mentioned in Sections 1 and 2) kept records of their victories, allowing for significant historical insight into their lives. While ordinary people like many farmers, herders, hunters, and gatherers (mentioned across Sections 1, 3, and 4) generally did not keep records, archaeology helps, but much about their lives remains unknown. However, inscriptions found in Mathura (Section 2) provide a unique type of record, detailing gifts made by a range of city dwellers, including crafts persons and merchants, offering glimpses into their activities and societal contributions.\n\nAnswer: The lives and societal roles varied significantly. In villages, there were hierarchical structures with large landowners (vellalar, grama bhojaka) often employing landless labourers and slaves (kadaisiyar, adimai, dasa karmakara), alongside independent farmers (uzhavar, grihapatis) and crafts persons. Tribal societies, by contrast, shared communal wealth, leading to fewer distinctions between rich and poor, with members engaging in hunting, gathering, farming, and herding with a clear division of labor. Urban centers like Mathura supported farmers, herders, various crafts persons (e.g., goldsmiths, weavers), merchants, officers, and royalty. These differences had implications for historical records: while kings and queens kept records of their achievements, providing substantial historical knowledge, ordinary people like hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers, and herders generally did not, meaning much about their lives remains unknown. However, archaeology and inscriptions (like those from Mathura detailing gifts from diverse city dwellers) offer some insights into their past."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.1.5", "6.9.7", "6.3.8", "6.9.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Men, women and children probably observed several things: the places where edible plants were found, how seeds broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. Perhaps they began looking after plants \u2014 protecting them from birds and animals so that they could grow and the seeds could ripen. In this way people became farmers. \nWomen, men and children could also attract and then tame animals by leaving food for them near their shelters. The first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that were relatively gentle to come near the camps where they lived. These animals such as sheep, goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and most of them ate grass. Often, people protected these animals from attacks by other wild animals. This is how they became herders. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nShankara, one of the most influential philosophers of India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century. He was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God which is the Ultimate Reality. He taught that Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless and without any attributes. He considered the world around us to be an illusion or maya, and preached renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman and attain salvation. \nRamanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars. According to him the best means of attaining salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu. Vishnu in His grace helps the devotee to attain the bliss of union with Him. He propounded the doctrine of Vishishtadvaita or qualified oneness in that the soul even when united with the Supreme God remained distinct. Ramanuja\u2019s doctrine greatly inspired the new strand of bhakti which developed in north India subsequently. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIn Chapter 4 you saw how the Mughal Empire reached the height of its success and started facing a variety of crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth century. These were caused by a number of factors. Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and financial resources of his empire by fighting a long war in the Deccan. \nUnder his successors, the efficiency of the imperial administration broke down. It became increasingly difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check on their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed as governors (subadars) often controlled the offices of revenue and military administration (diwani and faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, economic and military powers over vast regions of the Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their control over the provinces, the periodic remission of revenue to the capital declined. \nPeasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of northern and western India added to these problems. These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups were now able to seize the economic resources of the region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the gradual shifting of political and economic authority into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains and other groups. \nThe following is a contemporary writer\u2019s account of the financial bankruptcy of the empire: The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants\u2019 hands, like a peasant kept in his creditor\u2019s house until he can pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all order and administration that though the peasant reaps a harvest of gold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of straw. How then can the lord keep the armed force he should? How can he pay the soldiers who should go before him when he goes out, or the horsemen who should ride behind him? \nIn the midst of this economic and political crisis, the ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth. This invasion was followed by a series of plundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded north India five times between 1748 and 1761. \nThe devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah\u2019s invasion was described by contemporary observers. One described the wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows: sixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly one crore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of jewels, most of them unrivalled in the world, and the above included the Peacock throne. Another account described the invasion\u2019s impact upon Delhi: (those) \u2026 who had been masters were now in dire straits; and those who had been revered couldn\u2019t even (get water to) quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their corners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who once set the style in clothes now went naked; and those who owned property were now homeless \u2026 The New City (Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then attacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole world that existed there \u2026 \nAlready under severe pressure from all sides, the empire was further weakened by competition amongst different groups of nobles. They were divided into two major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis (nobles of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later Mughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either one or the other of these two powerful groups. The worst possible humiliation came when two Mughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713-1719) and Alamgir II (1754-1759) were assassinated, and two others Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) and Shah Alam II (1759-1816) were blinded by their nobles. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key internal and external factors that contributed to the decline of the Mughal Empire in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly details several factors contributing to the decline of the Mughal Empire. \n\nInternal Factors:\n1.  **Depletion of Resources:** Emperor Aurangzeb's long war in the Deccan depleted the empire's military and financial resources (Section 3: 'Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and financial resources of his empire by fighting a long war in the Deccan.').\n2.  **Administrative Breakdown:** The efficiency of imperial administration broke down under Aurangzeb's successors (Section 3: 'Under his successors, the efficiency of the imperial administration broke down.').\n3.  **Rise of Powerful Nobles:** Later Mughal emperors struggled to control powerful mansabdars.

Additions to the wall were made over a period of 2000 years because the frontiers of the empire kept shifting. The wall is about 6400 km long, and is made of stone and brick, with a road along the top. Several thousand people worked to build the wall. There are watch towers all along, at distances of about 100-200 m. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nArchaeologists have found traces of huts or houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, which were dug into the ground, with steps leading into them. These may have provided shelter in cold weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking hearths both inside and outside the huts, which suggests that, depending on the weather, people could cook food either indoors or outdoors. \nStone tools have been found from many sites as well. Many of these are different from the earlier Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles used for grinding grain and other plant produce. Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain even today, several thousand years later. At the same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued to be made and used, and remember, some tools were also made of bone. \nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been found. These were sometimes decorated, and were used for storing things. People began using pots for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat and lentils that now became an important part of the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using different kinds of materials, for example cotton, that could now be grown. \nDid things change everywhere and all at once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women still continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere people adopted farming and herding slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, in some cases people tried to combine these activities, doing different things during different seasons.imals \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Mehrgarh on Map 2 (page14). This site is located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass, which is one of the most important routes into Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places where women and men learnt to grow barley and wheat, and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know about. \nArchaeologists who excavated the site found evidence of many kinds of animal bones from the earliest levels. These included bones of wild animals such as the deer and pig. In later levels, they found more bones of sheep and goat, and in still later levels, cattle bones are most common, suggesting that this was the animal that was generally kept by the people. \nOther finds at Mehrgarh include remains of square or rectangular houses. Each house had four or more compartments, some of which may have been used for storage. \nWhen people die, their relatives and friends generally pay respect to them. People look after them, perhaps in the belief that there is some form of life after death. Burial is one such arrangement. Several burial sites have been found at Mehrgarh. In one instance, the dead person was buried with goats, which were probably meant to serve as food in the next world. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Agenda for a National Education \n\n British officials were not the only people thinking about education in India. From the early nineteenth century many thinkers from different parts of India began to talk of the need for a wider spread of education. Impressed with the developments in Europe, some Indians felt that Western education would help modernise India. They urged the British to open more schools, colleges and universities, and spend more money on education. There were other Indians, however, who reacted against Western education. Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore were two such individuals. Let us look at what they had to say. \n\u201cEnglish education has enslaved us\u201d \n Mahatma Gandhi argued that colonial education created a sense of inferiority in the minds of Indians. It made them see Western civilisation as superior, and destroyed the pride they had in their own culture. There was poison in this education, said Mahatma Gandhi, it was sinful, it enslaved Indians, it cast an evil spell on them. Charmed by the West, appreciating everything that came fr om the West, Indians educated in these institutions began admiring British rule. Mahatma Gandhi wanted an education that could help Indians recover their sense of dignity and self-respect. During the national movement he urged students to leave educational institutions in order to show to the British that Indians were no longer willing to be enslaved. \nMahatma Gandhi strongly felt that Indian languages ought to be the medium of teaching. Education in English crippled Indians, distanced them from their own social surroundings, and made them \u201cstrangers in their own lands\u201d. Speaking a foreign tongue, despising local culture, the English educated did not know how to relate to the masses. \nWestern education, Mahatma Gandhi said, focused on reading and writing rather than oral knowledge; it valued textbooks rather than lived experience and practical knowledge. He argued that education ought to develop a person\u2019s mind and soul. Literacy \u2013 or simply learning to read and write \u2013 by itself did not count as education. People had to work with their hands, learn a craft, and know how different things operated. This would develop their mind and their capacity to understand. As nationalist sentiments spread, other thinkers also began thinking of a system of national education which would be radically different from that set up by the British. \nTagore\u2019s \u201cabode of peace\u201d \n Many of you may have heard of Santiniketan. Do you know why it was established and by whom? Rabindranath Tagore started the institution in 1901. As a child, Tagore hated going to school. He found it suffocating and oppressive. The school appeared like a prison, for he could never do what he felt like doing. So while other children listened to the teacher, Tagore\u2019s mind would wander away. \nThe experience of his schooldays in Calcutta shaped Tagore\u2019s ideas of education. On growing up, he wanted to set up a school where the child was happy, where she could be free and creative, where she was able to explore her own thoughts and desires. Tagore felt that childhood ought to be a time of self-learning, outside the rigid and restricting discipline of the schooling system set up by the British. Teachers had to be imaginative, understand the child, and help the child develop her curiosity. According to Tagore, the existing schools killed the natural desire of the child to be creative, her sense of wonder. \nTagore was of the view that creative learning could be encouraged only within a natural environment. So he chose to set up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural setting. He saw it as an abode of peace (santiniketan ), where living in harmony with nature, children could cultivate their natural creativity. \nIn many senses Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi thought about education in similar ways. There were, however, differences too. Gandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship of machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements of modern Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within Indian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and technology at Santiniketan, along with art, music and dance. \nMany individuals and thinkers were thus thinking about the way a national educational system could be fashioned. Some wanted changes within the system set up by the British, and felt that the system could be extended so as to include wider sections of people. Others urged that alternative systems be created so that people were educated into a culture that was truly national. Who was to define what was truly national?

For Mehrgarh, the text describes its location in a fertile plain where inhabitants learned to grow barley and wheat and rear sheep and goats, indicating agricultural adaptation. Further evidence of evolving practices comes from the changing animal bones found, moving from wild animals (deer, pig) in earlier levels to domestic sheep, goat, and later cattle, showing a shift in animal husbandry. The presence of square or rectangular houses with compartments suggests settled life and storage. Burial sites, including one with goats, point to early cultural and ritualistic practices.\n\nFor Burzahom, the text highlights pit-houses dug into the ground with steps, which served as shelter in cold weather, demonstrating direct environmental adaptation. The discovery of cooking hearths both inside and outside huts indicates flexible cooking practices depending on the weather.\n\nGeneral Neolithic advancements mentioned in the text include the development of polished stone tools for fine cutting edges and mortars and pestles for grinding grain, signifying improved food processing. The use of earthen pots for storing and cooking grains, and the beginning of weaving cloth like cotton, further illustrate evolving material culture and dietary changes. These collective findings showcase how early humans adapted to their specific environments and developed increasingly complex practices in sustenance, shelter, and daily life.\n\nAnswer: Archaeological findings from Mehrgarh show adaptation through its location in a fertile plain, where inhabitants learned to cultivate barley and wheat and rear sheep and goats. Evolving practices are evident in the shift from wild animal bones to increasingly domestic ones (sheep, goat, then cattle), the construction of square or rectangular houses with storage compartments, and burial rituals including interring the dead with goats. In Burzahom, adaptation is seen in pit-houses providing shelter in cold weather and cooking hearths both indoors and outdoors, suggesting flexible responses to climate. General Neolithic advancements, such as polished stone tools, mortars and pestles for grinding grain, earthen pots for storage and cooking, and the development of weaving, further illustrate these evolving human practices and adaptations."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.9", "6.3.7", "6.8.8", "8.7.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

There are four of them \u2013 the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or \u201cwell-said\u201d. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. \nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis). Priests taught students to recite and memorise each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with great care. Most of the hymns were composed, taught and learnt by men. A few were composed by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. \nThe books we use are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind the Kurnool caves on Map 2 (page14).

He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what was the significance of the Sanskrit language in ancient Indian traditions and how did it feature in British educational policies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text on the Vedas explicitly states that the Rigveda, the oldest Veda composed approximately 3500 years ago, was written in \"old or Vedic Sanskrit.\" It also mentions that priests taught students to recite and memorise hymns in this language. Furthermore, the section on Kushana ruler Kanishka indicates that Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars began writing in Sanskrit around 1900 years ago. In the context of British educational policies, the 'Tradition of Orientalism' shows that scholars like William Jones devoted significant time to studying and translating \"Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry\" and \"ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences.\" This Orientalist view led to the establishment of institutions such as the Hindu College in Benaras in 1791 to \"encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts.\" However, this approach faced strong criticism from figures like Thomas Babington Macaulay, who argued against promoting Oriental learning. Consequently, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced, which decided to \"stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College,\" thereby ending the British government's support for the study of Sanskrit and other Oriental languages in higher education.\n\nAnswer: In ancient Indian traditions, Sanskrit was the language of the Rigveda, the oldest Veda, and was used for composing hymns and teaching by priests. Later, Buddhist scholars also adopted Sanskrit for their writings. During British rule, Orientalists like William Jones respected and studied ancient Sanskrit texts, leading to the establishment of institutions like the Hindu College in Benaras to promote Sanskrit studies. However, this policy was reversed by the English Education Act of 1835, which ceased the promotion of Oriental institutions that supported Sanskrit learning."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.2.5", "6.1.1", "6.5.1", "6.10.4", "8.7.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins.

People said he had miraculous powers \u2013 he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve all their problems. \nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas \u2013 a tribal group that lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region \u2013 Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be in danger. \nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? Who were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter. You have read about tribal societies last year. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe kings and kingdoms you have been reading about could not have existed without the support of flourishing villages.

Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region.

Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. \nThere are two groups who are described in terms of their work \u2014 the priests, sometimes called brahmins, who performed various rituals, and the rajas. \nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be learning about later. They did not have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Generally, sons did not automatically succeed fathers as rajas. \nTwo words were used to describe the people or the community as a whole. One was the word jana, which we still use in Hindi and other languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 6. \nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name. So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and so on. \nSometimes, the people who composed the hymns described themselves as Aryas and called their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were women and men who were often captured in war. They were treated as the property of their owners, who could make them do whatever work they wanted. \nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere.

Some of these are preserved in collections of stories such as the Jatakas and the Panchatantra, which were written down around this time. Stories from the Jatakas were often shown on the railings of stupas and in paintings in places such as Ajanta. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIf the context in which information is produced changes with time, what about language and meanings? Historical records exist in a variety of languages which have changed considerably over the years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different from modern Persian. The difference is not just with regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of words also change over time. \nTake the term \u201cHindustan\u201d, for example. Today we understand it as \u201cIndia\u201d, the modern nation-state. When the term was used in the thirteenth century by Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler who wrote in Persian, he meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term in a political sense for lands that were a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan. The areas included in this term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but the term never included south India. By contrast, in the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used the word \u201cHind\u201d. While the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like \u201cIndia\u201d did exist, the term \u201cHindustan\u201d did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with it today. \nHistorians today have to be careful about the terms they use because they meant different things in the past. Take, for example, a simple term like \u201cforeigner\u201d. It is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian. In the medieval period a \u201cforeigner\u201d was any stranger who appeared say in a given village, someone who was not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term pardesi might be used to describe such a person and in Persian, ajnabi.) A city-dweller, therefore, might have regarded a forest-dweller as a \u201cforeigner\u201d, but two peasants living in the same village were not foreigners to each other, even though they may have had different religious or caste backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAround the time that the Buddha was preaching and perhaps a little earlier, other thinkers also tried to find answers to difficult questions. Some of them wanted to know about life after death, others wanted to know why sacrifices should be performed. Many of these thinkers felt that there was something permanent in the universe that would last even after death. They described this as the atman or the individual soul and the brahman or the universal soul. They believed that ultimately, both the atman and the brahman were one. \nMany of their ideas were recorded in the Upanishads. These were part of the later Vedic texts. Upanishad literally means \u2018approaching and sitting near\u2019 and the texts contain conversations between teachers and students. Often, ideas were presented through simple dialogues. \nMost Upanishadic thinkers were men, especially brahmins and rajas. Occasionally, there is mention of women thinkers, such as Gargi, who was famous for her learning, and participated in debates held in royal courts. Poor people rarely took part in these discussions. One famous exception was Satyakama Jabala, who was named after his mother, the slave woman Jabali. He had a deep desire to learn about reality, was accepted as a student by a brahmin teacher named Gautama, and became one of the best-known thinkers of the time. Many of the ideas of the Upanishads were later developed by the famous thinker Shankaracharya, about whom you will read in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, how did the meaning and application of the term 'Hindustan' evolve from the thirteenth century to the early sixteenth century, and how did these historical meanings differ from its modern understanding?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text in the second section explicitly discusses the term 'Hindustan' and its changing meanings over time.\n2. In the thirteenth century, Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler writing in Persian, used 'Hindustan' in a 'political sense for lands that were a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan,' specifically referring to 'the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna.'

Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the administrative measures implemented by Sultan Alauddin Khalji and Sultan Muhammad Tughluq in response to the Mongol threat and the challenge of maintaining a large standing army."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will compare the specific administrative measures taken by Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq based on the provided text, focusing on how they dealt with housing, feeding, paying their soldiers, and managing the economic impact of a large army. \n\n**Alauddin Khalji's Measures:**\n1.  **Garrison Town:** The text states, \"Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers.\" \n2.  **Feeding Soldiers:** \"This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna.

Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBoth the Mahavira and the Buddha felt that only those who left their homes could gain true knowledge. They arranged for them to stay together in the sangha, an association of those who left their homes. \nThe rules made for the Buddhist sangha were written down in a book called the Vinaya Pitaka. From this we know that there were separate branches for men and women. All men could join the sangha. However, children had to take the permission of their parents and slaves that of their masters. Those who worked for the king had to take his permission and debtors that of creditors. Women had to take their husbands\u2019 permission. \nMen and women who joined the sangha led simple lives. They meditated for most of the time, and went to cities and villages to beg for food during fixed hours. That is why they were known as bhikkhus (the Prakrit word for renouncer \u2014 beggar) and bhikkhunis. They taught others, and helped one another. They also held meetings to settle any quarrels that took place within the sangha. \nThose who joined the sangha included brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants, labourers, barbers, courtesans and slaves. Many of them wrote down the teachings of the Buddha. Some of them also composed beautiful poems, describing their life in the sangha. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently. The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIf the context in which information is produced changes with time, what about language and meanings? Historical records exist in a variety of languages which have changed considerably over the years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different from modern Persian. The difference is not just with regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of words also change over time. \nTake the term \u201cHindustan\u201d, for example. Today we understand it as \u201cIndia\u201d, the modern nation-state. When the term was used in the thirteenth century by Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler who wrote in Persian, he meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term in a political sense for lands that were a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan. The areas included in this term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but the term never included south India. By contrast, in the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used the word \u201cHind\u201d. While the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like \u201cIndia\u201d did exist, the term \u201cHindustan\u201d did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with it today. \nHistorians today have to be careful about the terms they use because they meant different things in the past. Take, for example, a simple term like \u201cforeigner\u201d. It is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian. In the medieval period a \u201cforeigner\u201d was any stranger who appeared say in a given village, someone who was not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term pardesi might be used to describe such a person and in Persian, ajnabi.) A city-dweller, therefore, might have regarded a forest-dweller as a \u201cforeigner\u201d, but two peasants living in the same village were not foreigners to each other, even though they may have had different religious or caste backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors led to the decline of Indian textiles in global markets and what were the primary consequences for Indian weavers and spinners?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text 'Indian Textiles and the World Market' describes the decline of Indian textiles. Several factors contributed to this decline:\n1.  **Competition:** Indian textiles faced competition from British textiles in European and American markets. (Paragraph: 'The decline of Indian textiles', 'First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets.')\n2.  **High Duties:** Exporting textiles to England became difficult due to very high duties imposed on Indian textiles. (Paragraph: 'The decline of Indian textiles', 'Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain.')\n3.  **British Protective Legislation:** The British government enacted legislation like the Calico Act in 1720, banning the use of printed Indian cotton textiles (chintz) in England to protect its nascent textile industry. (Paragraph: 'Indian textiles in European markets', 'In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act.')\n4.  **Technological Innovations in Britain:** Inventions like the spinning jenny (1764) and the steam engine (1786) revolutionized cotton textile production in England, enabling immense quantities of cloth to be woven cheaply. (Paragraph: 'Indian textiles in European markets', 'Competition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented... The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too.')\n5.  **Colonial Economic Policies:** The English East India Company, after gaining political power in Bengal, stopped importing silver to buy Indian goods. Instead, they used revenues collected from Indian peasants and zamindars to purchase textiles, altering the trade dynamics. (Paragraph: 'Indian textiles in European markets', 'These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles.')\n6.  **Flooding of Indian Markets:** By the 1830s, British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets, displacing Indian goods from their traditional markets and even within India. (Paragraph: 'The decline of Indian textiles', 'By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe.')\n\nThese factors led to several consequences for Indian weavers and spinners:\n1.  **Mass Unemployment:** Thousands of weavers and spinners were thrown out of employment, with Bengal weavers being particularly hard hit. (Paragraph: 'The decline of Indian textiles', 'Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit.', 'Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless.')\n2.  **Loss of Advances:** English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents ceased giving advances to weavers. (Paragraph: 'The decline of Indian textiles', 'English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies.')\n3.  **Migration and Occupational Shift:** Many weavers became agricultural labourers, some migrated to cities for work, and others went abroad to work in plantations. Some also found work in the new cotton mills established in India. (Paragraph: 'What happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood?', 'Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur.')\n\nAnswer: The decline of Indian textiles was caused by several factors: competition from British textiles in global markets, high import duties imposed on Indian goods by Britain, protective legislation like the Calico Act banning Indian printed cloth in England, and technological advancements (spinning jenny, steam engine) in Britain that enabled cheaper mass production. Additionally, the East India Company's shift to using Indian revenues for purchases rather than imported silver impacted trade. Consequently, thousands of Indian weavers and spinners lost their livelihoods, especially in Bengal, as European companies stopped buying their products and issuing advances. Many were forced to become agricultural labourers, migrate to cities, work in plantations abroad, or eventually find employment in India's emerging cotton mills."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.3", "6.7.6", "7.1.2", "8.6.2", "6.12.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The only time they stayed in one place was during the rainy season, when it was very difficult to travel. Then, their supporters built temporary shelters for them in gardens, or they lived in natural caves in hilly areas. \nAs time went on, many supporters of the monks and nuns, and they themselves, felt the need for more permanent shelters and so monasteries were built. These were known as viharas. The earliest viharas were made of wood, and then of brick. Some were even in caves that were dug out in hills, especially in western India. \nVery often, the land on which the vihara was built was donated by a rich merchant or a landowner, or the king. The local people came with gifts of food, clothing and medicines for the monks and nuns. In return, they taught the people. Over the centuries, Buddhism spread to many parts of the subcontinent and beyond. You will learn more about this in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nTurn to Map 2 (page14). You will notice a number of blue squares. Each marks a site from where archaeologists have found evidence of early farmers and herders. These are found all over the subcontinent. Some of the most important ones are in the north-west, in present-day Kashmir, and in east and south India \nTo find out whether these sites were settlements of farmers and herders, scientists study evidence of plants and animal bones. One of the most exciting finds includes remains of burnt grain. (These may have been burnt accidentally or on purpose). Scientists can identify these grains, and so we know that a number of crops were grown in different parts of the subcontinent. They can also identify the bones of different animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the primary political aims of the Birsa Munda movement, and what were its two significant long-term impacts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states the political aim of the Birsa movement: 'What worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head.' \n\nFor the long-term impacts, the text clearly outlines them at the end of the Birsa Munda section: 'However, the movement was significant in at least two ways.

So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what factors contributed to the evolution of the Bengali language from a non-Sanskritic origin to one derived from Sanskrit, and what other linguistic influences shaped modern Bengali?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages,' despite Bengali now being recognized as derived from Sanskrit. The evolution began with 'commercial ties' developing between Bengal and Magadha from the 'fourth-third centuries BCE,' which 'may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit.' This influence was further solidified in the 'fourth century' when 'Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area,' making the 'linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger.'

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars. \nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble\u2019s position in court and the larger his salary. \nNobles with a zat of 5,000 were ranked higher than those of 1,000. In Akbar\u2019s reign there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars had increased to 79. \nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary. \nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country. \nIn Akbar\u2019s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb\u2019s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUsually two to three generations live together in small settlements or villages. Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together. There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Beyond the structure of the mansabdari system, how did the Mughal Empire engage with and influence the regional administrative and cultural landscapes of areas like Bengal and Puri, Orissa?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about Mughal engagement and influence on regional administrative and cultural landscapes in Bengal and Puri, Orissa, specifically beyond the mansabdari system. \n\n1.  **Mughal engagement in Bengal (Section 2):** The text states that in 1586, Akbar conquered Bengal, and it 'formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba'. Administratively, 'Persian was the language of administration'. Culturally, 'Bengali developed as a regional language', and by the fifteenth century, its dialects united into a common literary language, incorporating non-Sanskrit words. This shows the Mughals established a formal administrative unit and language while allowing regional linguistic and cultural development.\n2.  **Mughal engagement in Puri, Orissa (Section 5):** The text describes the cult of Jagannatha at Puri as a significant regional religious tradition. It states that as the temple gained importance as a center of pilgrimage, 'its authority in social and political matters also increased'. Consequently, 'All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals... attempted to gain control over the temple' because 'They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people'. This indicates a strategy of leveraging existing local religious and political authority to legitimize imperial rule.\n3.  **Synthesis:** While the mansabdari system (detailed in Section 1) was a general imperial administrative and military structure, in specific regions like Bengal, the Mughals established direct administrative units (suba) with an official language (Persian) but also saw the parallel development of a strong regional language. In Orissa, their engagement involved attempting to control a powerful religious institution (Jagannatha temple) to secure local acceptance, highlighting a nuanced approach to integrating diverse regions.\n\nAnswer: In Bengal, the Mughal Empire integrated the region as a 'suba' under Akbar's reign, establishing Persian as the language of administration, but simultaneously, Bengali developed as a prominent regional language. In Puri, Orissa, the Mughals engaged by attempting to gain control over the revered Jagannatha temple, recognizing its increased authority in social and political matters, believing that this control would make their rule acceptable to the local populace."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.4.6", "7.9.7", "8.5.2", "6.3.8", "7.9.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThere are several ways of finding out about the past. One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men and women (including kings and queens) recorded what they did. For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties? There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone, others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that are made of hard, imperishable substances usually survive for a long time. \nArchaeologists also look for bones \u2014 of animals, birds, and fish \u2014 to find out what people ate in the past. Plant remains survive far more rarely \u2014 if seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt, they survive in a charred form. Do you think cloth is found frequently by archaeologists? \nHistorians, that is, scholars who study the past, often use the word source to refer to the information found from manuscripts, inscriptions and archaeology. Once sources are found, learning about the past becomes an adventure, as we reconstruct it bit by bit. So historians and archaeologists are like detectives, who use all these sources like clues to find out about our pasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of new religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) who came from all castes including those considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages they visited, and set them to music. \nThere were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different caste backgrounds such as potters, \u201cuntouchable\u201d workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and chiefs. The best known among them were Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are two sets of compilations of their songs \u2013 Tevaram and Tiruvacakam. There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally divergent backgrounds, the best known being Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya Prabandham. \nBetween the tenth and twelfth centuries the Chola and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening the links between the bhakti tradition and temple worship. This was also the time when their poems were compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also composed. Today we use these texts as sources for writing histories of the bhakti tradition. \nHagiography : Writing of saints\u2019 lives. \nThis is a composition of Manikkavasagar: Into my vile body of flesh You came, as though it were a temple of gold, And soothed me wholly and saved me, O Lord of Grace, O Gem most Pure, Sorrow and birth and death and illusion You took from me, and set me free. O Bliss! O Light! I have taken refuge in You, And never can I be parted from You. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have given lengthy names for the time that we are studying. They call the earliest period the Palaeolithic. This comes from two Greek words, \u2018palaeo\u2019, meaning old, and \u2018lithos\u2019, meaning stone. The name points to the importance of finds of stone tools. The Palaeolithic period extends from 2 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago. This long stretch of time is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This long span of time covers 99% of human history. \nThe period when we find environmental changes, beginning about 12,000 years ago till about 10,000 years ago is called the Mesolithic (middle stone). Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are called microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or wood to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older varieties of tools continued to be in use. \nThe next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what types of sources do historians utilize to understand the Bhakti tradition, specifically concerning the Nayanars and Alvars?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

Through the eighteenth century, the Mughal Empire gradually fragmented into a number of independent, regional states. Broadly speaking the states of the eighteenth century can be divided into three overlapping groups: (1) States that were old Mughal provinces like Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. Although extremely powerful and quite independent, the rulers of these states did not break their formal ties with the Mughal emperor. (2) States that had enjoyed considerable independence under the Mughals as watan jagirs. These included several Rajput principalities. (3) The last group included states under the control of Marathas, Sikhs and others like the Jats. These were of differing sizes and had seized their independence from the Mughals after a long-drawn armed struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFallow \u2013 A field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility. Sal \u2013 A tree. Mahua \u2013 A flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol. Bewar \u2013 A term used in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation. \nHow Did Tribal Groups Live? \n\n By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities. Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times?

Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nYou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts, crafts and production activities flourished in towns and villages. Over the centuries important political, social and economic developments had taken place. But social change was not the same everywhere, because different kinds of societies evolved differently. It is important to understand how, and why, this happened. \nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms. The difference between the high and low, and between the rich and poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did British policies regarding vernacular education and tribal forest resources contribute to social changes and local grievances that eventually fueled the broader nationalist movement in India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The British significantly altered existing social structures and practices through their policies. In education, prior to 1854, local pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar operated with a flexible system, allowing children from poor peasant families to attend by accommodating their work during harvest times. However, after 1854, the Company introduced new routines and rules, demanding regular attendance and fixed fees. This new system disadvantaged poor peasant children, who were unable to attend regularly due to their need to work in the fields, leading to their exclusion from the formalized education system. This represents a significant social change and a source of grievance among the common people. \n\nConcurrently, British policies impacted tribal communities. Tribal groups, such as jhum cultivators and hunter-gatherers, depended on free movement within forests and the use of forest resources for their livelihoods. The colonial state restricted their access to these essential resources. This restriction directly threatened their way of life and survival, causing significant hardship and discontent among these communities. \n\nThese specific grievances, stemming from British policies on education and forest resources, became intertwined with the growing nationalist movement. For instance, during the Non-Cooperation Movement, tribals and poor peasants in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh staged 'forest satyagrahas' to protest against restricted forest use, believing that Mahatma Gandhi would help reduce their taxes and abolish forest regulations. Similarly, peasants in Kheda, Gujarat, protested high land revenue demands. These local struggles, rooted in social and economic changes imposed by the British, were interpreted by the people as part of the larger fight for 'swaraj' and against colonial rule, demonstrating how specific British policies contributed to widespread discontent and provided impetus to the mass nationalist movement.\n\nAnswer: British policies transformed vernacular education by replacing flexible, locally-suited pathshalas with rigid, fee-based systems that disadvantaged poor peasant children. Simultaneously, the colonial state restricted tribal access to vital forest resources, disrupting their traditional livelihoods. These specific grievances among peasants and tribals, such as those seen in 'forest satyagrahas' and protests against educational changes, became localized expressions of resistance that fed into and strengthened the broader nationalist movement, linking their struggles to the demand for 'swaraj' and an end to colonial rule."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.1", "8.7.2", "8.4.2", "7.10.3", "8.9.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

You will notice that after the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra until 1526. By then, Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals. This was also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs. \nSome of the states established in this period were small but powerful and extremely well administered. Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun (1530-1540, 1555-1556). Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty. Although the Sur dynasty ruled for only fifteen years (1540-1555), it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made them more efficient. Sher Shah\u2019s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar (1556-1605) when he consolidated the Mughal Empire. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here. At some sites, a large number of tools, used for all sorts of activities, were found. These were probably habitation-cum factory sites. In some of the other, smaller sites, there is evidence to suggest that tools were made. Some of the sites were close to springs. Most tools were made from limestone, which was locally available \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago. He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIf the context in which information is produced changes with time, what about language and meanings? Historical records exist in a variety of languages which have changed considerably over the years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different from modern Persian. The difference is not just with regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of words also change over time. \nTake the term \u201cHindustan\u201d, for example. Today we understand it as \u201cIndia\u201d, the modern nation-state. When the term was used in the thirteenth century by Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler who wrote in Persian, he meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term in a political sense for lands that were a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan. The areas included in this term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but the term never included south India. By contrast, in the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used the word \u201cHind\u201d. While the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like \u201cIndia\u201d did exist, the term \u201cHindustan\u201d did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with it today. \nHistorians today have to be careful about the terms they use because they meant different things in the past. Take, for example, a simple term like \u201cforeigner\u201d. It is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian. In the medieval period a \u201cforeigner\u201d was any stranger who appeared say in a given village, someone who was not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term pardesi might be used to describe such a person and in Persian, ajnabi.) A city-dweller, therefore, might have regarded a forest-dweller as a \u201cforeigner\u201d, but two peasants living in the same village were not foreigners to each other, even though they may have had different religious or caste backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the two distinct features of Mahayana Buddhism, and how did its spread compare to that of Theravada Buddhism, according to the text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'A new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed.

The text also describes the spread of Mahayana Buddhism, noting it 'spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan' and also to 'western and southern India'. In contrast, it states that 'The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas' which are identified as 'Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia.'

In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us see what Samudragupta\u2019s prashasti tells us. The poet praised the king in glowing terms \u2014 as a warrior, as a king who won victories in battle, who was learned and the best of poets. He is also described as equal to the gods. The prashasti was composed in very long sentences. \nHarishena describes four different kinds of rulers, and tells us about Samudragupta\u2019s policies towards them. \n1. The rulers of Aryavarta, the area shaded in green on the map. Here there were nine rulers who were uprooted, and their kingdoms were made a part of Samudragupta\u2019s empire. \n2. The rulers of Dakshinapatha. Here there were twelve rulers, some of whose capitals are marked with red dots on the map.

Akbar's minister Todar Mal established the 'zabt' revenue system, fixing taxes on crops in cash, applicable where land could be surveyed. The text also notes that zamindars could exercise power and even, along with peasants, rebel against Mughal authority, indicating a form of control that was not always absolute or uniformly applied (e.g., not in Gujarat and Bengal).\n\n**Samudragupta's Empire:** The second text details Harishena's description of Samudragupta's policies towards four different kinds of rulers. These included: 1) uprooting rulers and incorporating their kingdoms into the empire (Aryavarta); 2) defeating rulers but allowing them to rule again after surrender (Dakshinapatha); 3) receiving tribute, obedience, and court attendance from inner circle neighbouring states; and 4) receiving submission and offers of daughters in marriage from rulers of outlying areas like the Kushanas, Shakas, and Sri Lanka.\n\n**Comparison:** The Mughal Empire primarily managed control through a centralized revenue system ('zabt') administered via local intermediaries ('zamindars'), though this system had geographical limitations and faced internal resistance. Samudragupta's empire, on the other hand, employed a more varied approach, ranging from direct annexation, to establishing vassal states, demanding tribute and obedience, and forming diplomatic alliances through marriage, depending on the proximity and nature of the other rulers.\n\nAnswer: The Mughal Empire primarily managed control through a tax system ('zabt') administered by intermediaries ('zamindars'), which was applicable in surveyed areas but also faced rebellions from these groups.

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains. But it was difficult to keep this balance all the time. Look at Table 1 again \u2013 note that Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji when he came to accept Mughal authority. What was the consequence of this insult? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n\u201cGeneral\u201dconstituencies - Election districts with no reservations for any religious or other community \nQuit India and Later \n\n Mahatma Gandhi decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British in the middle of the Second World War. The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nYou read about the Northern Black Polished Ware in Chapter 9. This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these long journeys. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare the strategies employed by Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi to achieve Indian independence and the immediate outcomes of these strategies as described in the text."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify Subhas Chandra Bose's strategy**: The text in the 'Bose and the INA' section states that Bose 'did not share Gandhiji\u2019s ideal of ahimsa' and instead 'raised the Azad Hind Fauj or the Indian National Army (INA)' to 'free India from British control' by attempting to 'enter India through Imphal and Kohima'.

The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. \nSome important megalithic sites are shown on Map 2 (page14). While some megaliths can be seen on the surface, other megalithic burials are often underground. \nSometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground.

Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere are several ways of describing people \u2014 in terms of the work they do, the language they speak, the place they belong to, their family, their communities and cultural practices. Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. \nThere are two groups who are described in terms of their work \u2014 the priests, sometimes called brahmins, who performed various rituals, and the rajas. \nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be learning about later. They did not have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Generally, sons did not automatically succeed fathers as rajas. \nTwo words were used to describe the people or the community as a whole. One was the word jana, which we still use in Hindi and other languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 6. \nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name. So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and so on. \nSometimes, the people who composed the hymns described themselves as Aryas and called their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were women and men who were often captured in war. They were treated as the property of their owners, who could make them do whatever work they wanted. \nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of these. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key characteristics of the traditional pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar as reported by William Adam, and how did the British Company's reforms after 1854 change this system, particularly for poor peasant children?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought begins by identifying the characteristics of traditional pathshalas from William Adam's report. According to the text, Adam found over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar, which were small institutions, often without fixed fees, printed books, separate school buildings, benches, blackboards, separate classes, roll-call registers, annual examinations, or regular timetables. Teaching was oral, fees depended on parents' income, and gurus decided the curriculum. A crucial feature was the flexible timetable, where classes were not held during harvest time, allowing children from peasant families to work in the fields and still study. Next, I will extract how the British Company's reforms after 1854 changed this system. The text states that the Company aimed to introduce order by appointing government pandits, requiring gurus to submit periodic reports, imposing regular timetables, introducing textbook-based teaching, annual examinations, regular fees, fixed seats, and new rules of discipline. Finally, I will explain the consequences for poor peasant children. The text highlights that while the earlier flexible system accommodated poor peasant children, the new system's demand for regular attendance, even during harvest time, made it difficult for them to attend, and their absence was then perceived as indiscipline.\n\nAnswer: As reported by William Adam in the 1830s, traditional pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar were flexible institutions. They lacked fixed fees, printed books, separate school buildings, benches, blackboards, separate classes, roll-call registers, annual examinations, and regular timetables. Classes were often held under banyan trees, in village shops, temples, or at the guru's home. Fees varied with parental income, teaching was oral, and the guru determined the curriculum.

After 1854, the British Company introduced reforms to 'improve' vernacular education by imposing order. This included appointing government pandits, requiring gurus to submit periodic reports and follow regular timetables, introducing textbook-based teaching and annual examinations. Students were mandated to pay regular fees, attend regularly, sit on fixed seats, and adhere to new rules of discipline.

Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people become different from wild plants and animals. This is because people select plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select those plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select plants that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of bearing the weight of the ripe grain. Seeds from selected plants are preserved and sown to ensure that new plants (and seeds) will have the same qualities. \nAmongst animals, those that are relatively gentle are selected for breeding. As a result, gradually, domesticated animals and plants become different from wild animals and plants. For example, the teeth and horns of wild animals are usually much larger than those of domesticated animals. \nDomestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts of the world. It began about 12,000 years ago. Virtually all the plant and animal produce that we use as food today is a result of domestication. Some of the earliest plants to be domesticated were wheat and barley. The earliest domesticated animals include sheep and goat. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nQazi \u2013 A judge \n Mufti \u2013 A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer \n Impeachment \u2013 A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons \n Dharmashastras \u2013 Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 BCE onwards \n Sawar \u2013 Men on horses \n Musket \u2013 A heavy gun used by infantry soldiers \n Matchlock \u2013 An early type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match \nSetting up a New Administration \n\n Warren Hastings (Governor-General from 1773 to 1785) was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts \u2013 a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat ). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors. \nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta. \nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. His office \u2013 the Collectorate \u2013 became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. \nThe Company army \n Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. \nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry requirements of the Company\u2019s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of the Company\u2019s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century the British began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIn Chapter 4 you saw how the Mughal Empire reached the height of its success and started facing a variety of crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth century. These were caused by a number of factors. Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and financial resources of his empire by fighting a long war in the Deccan. \nUnder his successors, the efficiency of the imperial administration broke down. It became increasingly difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check on their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed as governors (subadars) often controlled the offices of revenue and military administration (diwani and faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, economic and military powers over vast regions of the Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their control over the provinces, the periodic remission of revenue to the capital declined. \nPeasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of northern and western India added to these problems. These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups were now able to seize the economic resources of the region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the gradual shifting of political and economic authority into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains and other groups. \nThe following is a contemporary writer\u2019s account of the financial bankruptcy of the empire: The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants\u2019 hands, like a peasant kept in his creditor\u2019s house until he can pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all order and administration that though the peasant reaps a harvest of gold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of straw. How then can the lord keep the armed force he should? How can he pay the soldiers who should go before him when he goes out, or the horsemen who should ride behind him? \nIn the midst of this economic and political crisis, the ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth. This invasion was followed by a series of plundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded north India five times between 1748 and 1761. \nThe devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah\u2019s invasion was described by contemporary observers. One described the wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows: sixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly one crore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of jewels, most of them unrivalled in the world, and the above included the Peacock throne. Another account described the invasion\u2019s impact upon Delhi: (those) \u2026 who had been masters were now in dire straits; and those who had been revered couldn\u2019t even (get water to) quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their corners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who once set the style in clothes now went naked; and those who owned property were now homeless \u2026 The New City (Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then attacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole world that existed there \u2026 \nAlready under severe pressure from all sides, the empire was further weakened by competition amongst different groups of nobles. They were divided into two major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis (nobles of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later Mughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either one or the other of these two powerful groups. The worst possible humiliation came when two Mughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713-1719) and Alamgir II (1754-1759) were assassinated, and two others Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) and Shah Alam II (1759-1816) were blinded by their nobles. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the administrative and military structures of India evolve from the late Mughal period to the early British East India Company's rule, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires synthesizing information from the first two text sections regarding the decline of the Mughal Empire and the establishment of the British East India Company's administration and military. \n\n**Late Mughal Period (Section 1):**\n1.  **Administrative Structure:** The imperial administration broke down under Aurangzeb's successors. Powerful nobles appointed as governors (subadars) consolidated control over provinces, often controlling both revenue (diwani) and military (faujdari) administration. This gave them extraordinary political, economic, and military powers, leading to a decline in revenue remission to the capital. The central authority was unable to prevent the shifting of political and economic power to provincial governors, local chieftains, and other groups. Emperors became puppets, and some were even assassinated or blinded by their nobles.\n2.  **Military Structure:** The text mentions that due to financial bankruptcy, great lords were helpless and impoverished, unable to maintain the armed forces they should have, meaning a weakened and decentralized military capability.\n\n**Early British East India Company Rule (Section 2):**\n1.  **Administrative Structure:** Warren Hastings introduced a new system of justice from 1772, establishing two courts in each district: a criminal court (faujdari adalat) and a civil court (diwani adalat). European district collectors presided over civil courts and supervised criminal courts. The 'Collector' became the principal figure in an Indian district, responsible for collecting revenue and taxes, and maintaining law and order, effectively becoming the new center of power and patronage, replacing previous holders of authority. British territories were divided into Presidencies (Bengal, Madras, Bombay), each ruled by a Governor, with a Governor-General (Warren Hastings being the first) as the supreme head of administration. The Regulating Act of 1773 established a new Supreme Court and a court of appeal (Sadar Nizamat Adalat) at Calcutta, and efforts were made to compile uniform Hindu and Muslim laws.\n2.  **Military Structure:** The Company created a 'sepoy army' by recruiting peasants and training them as professional soldiers, a method adopted from Mughal successor states. As warfare technology changed from the 1820s (e.g., muskets, matchlocks), the Company's army's cavalry requirements declined, and infantry regiments became more important. The British developed a uniform military culture, subjecting soldiers to European-style training, drill, and discipline, which often ignored caste and community feelings.\n\n**Evolution:** The evolution shows a shift from a decentralized, fragmented, and weakening Mughal administration and military, where local powers gained autonomy and central control eroded, to a more centralized, structured, and professional British administration with distinct judicial and revenue systems, and a disciplined, modern infantry-focused army. The British actively sought to replace previous holders of authority and establish a uniform system, contrasting sharply with the breakdown of order in the late Mughal period.\n\nAnswer: From the late Mughal period to the early British East India Company's rule, administrative control shifted from a fragmented and weakened central authority, where provincial governors and local chieftains gained significant power and controlled revenue and military functions, to a centralized system under the British. The Company established Presidencies, introduced a new justice system with district collectors as key figures overseeing revenue, law, and order, and compiled uniform laws. Militarily, the Mughal reliance on traditional cavalry and locally supplied infantry gave way to the Company's professional 'sepoy army' which recruited and trained peasants, eventually emphasizing disciplined infantry armed with muskets and matchlocks through European-style training and uniform military culture, moving away from cavalry dominance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.10.2", "8.2.4", "6.3.3", "7.9.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Let us look at the example of Mathura (Map 7, page 113). \nMathura has been an important settlement for more than 2500 years. It was important because it was located at the cross roads of two major routes of travel and trade \u2014 from the northwest to the east and from north to south. There were fortifications around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and herders from adjoining areas provided food for people in the city. Mathura was also a centre where some extremely fine sculpture was produced. \nAround 2000 years ago Mathura became the second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you will be reading in Chapter 10. Mathura was also a religious centre \u2014 there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, and it was an important centre for the worship of Krishna.ks \nmoSeveral inscriptions on surfaces such as stone slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to monasteries and shrines. These were made by kings and queens, officers, merchants, and crafts persons who lived in the city.

The towns people are all praise for its architect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan who has proudly carved his name on the temple wall. Inside is a massive Shiva linga. \nBesides the temple, there are palaces with mandapas or pavilions. Kings hold court in these mandapas, issuing orders to their subordinates. There are also barracks for the army. \nThe town is bustling with markets selling grain, spices, cloth and jewellery. Water supply for the town comes from wells and tanks. The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses. Some distance away at Svamimalai, the sthapatis or sculptors are making exquisite bronze idols and tall, ornamental bell metal lamps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBABUR 1526-1530 : 1526 \u2013 defeated Ibrahim Lodi and his Afghan supporters at Panipat. 1527 \u2013 defeated Rana Sanga, Rajput rulers and allies at Khanua. 1528 \u2013 defeated the Rajputs at Chanderi; Established control over Agra and Delhi before his death. \nHUMAYUN 1530-1540, 1555-1556 : (1) Humayun divided his inheritance according to the will of his father. His brothers were each given a province. The ambitions of his brother Mirza Kamran weakened Humayun\u2019s cause against Afghan competitors. Sher Khan defeated Humayun at Chausa (1539) and Kanauj (1540), forcing him to flee to Iran. (2) In Iran Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah. He recaptured Delhi in 1555 but died the next year after an accident in this building. \nAKBAR 1556-1605 : Akbar was 13 years old when he became emperor. His reign can be divided into three periods. (1) 1556-1570 \u2013 Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed. Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan, rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir\u2019s wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful. \nShah Jahan 1627-1658 : Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632 Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan\u2019s sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra. \nAurangzeb 1658-1707 : (1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas.

Notice how the boundaries of the Mughal Empire were reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent kingdoms. By 1765, notice how another power, the British, had successfully grabbed major chunks of territory in eastern India. What these maps tell us is that political conditions in eighteenthcentury India changed quite dramatically and within a relatively short span of time. \nIn this chapter we will read about the emergence of new political groups in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century \u2013 roughly from 1707, when Aurangzeb died, till the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period. At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what characterized the political landscape and the emergence of new power groups in the Indian subcontinent between the 8th and mid-18th centuries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about the political landscape and the emergence of new power groups from the 8th century to the mid-18th century, requiring synthesis from both text sections. \n\n**From the first text section (covering 700-1750):**\n1.

The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today. Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the European companies within these new cities. The \u201cblacks\u201d or native traders and craftspersons were confined here while the \u201cwhite\u201d rulers occupied the superior residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St. William in Calcutta.

If the sealing was intact, one could be sure that the goods had arrived safely. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments. Among them were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis. They advocated renunciation of the world. To them the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realisation of oneness with it. To achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation. These groups became particularly popular among \u201clow\u201d castes. Their criticism of conventional religion created the ground for devotional religion to become a popular force in northern India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe main source of income available to Mughal rulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority.

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the two immediate challenges India faced upon gaining independence in August 1947?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges.'

Rana Pratap ascended the throne at Mewar in 1572, with Udaipur and large part of Mewar under his control. A series of envoys were sent to the Rana to persuade him to accept Mughal suzerainty, but he stood his ground. \nMany Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional politics at the Mughal court. \nThese influential Rajput families claimed the subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa. Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial territories neighbouring their watans. Nagaur was conquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, while Amber seized large portions of Bundi. Sawai Raja Jai Singh founded his new capital at Jaipur and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe pressure on these principalities and checked their further expansion. \nMany Rajput chieftains built a number of forts on hill tops which became centres of power. With extensive fortifications, these majestic structures housed urban centres, palaces, temples, trading centres, water harvesting structures and other buildings. The Chittorgarh fort contained many water bodies varying from talabs (ponds) to kundis (wells), baolis (stepwells), etc. \nA description of Raja Jai Singh in a Persian account of 1732: Raja Jai Singh was at the height of his power. He was the governor of Agra for 12 years and of Malwa for 5 or 6 years. He possessed a large army, artillery and great wealth. His sway extended from Delhi to the banks of the Narmada. \nSawai Jai Singh, the ruler of Amber constructed five astronomical observatories, one each in Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, Mathura and Varanasi. Commonly known as Jantar Mantar, these observatories had various instruments to study heavenly bodies. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did influential Rajput families attempt to extend their control and territories in the eighteenth century, and which prominent rulers were mentioned in this context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'In the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to extend their control over adjacent regions.'

These deities included Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as Durga. \nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti, an idea that became very popular at this time. Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti. \nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is included in the Mahabharata (see Chapter 12). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna, his devotee and friend, to abandon all dharmas and take refuge in him, as only he can set Arjuna free from every evil. This form of worship gradually spread to different parts of the country. \nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasised devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices. \nAccording to this system of belief, if a devotee worships the chosen deity with a pure heart, the deity will appear in the form in which he or she may desire. So, the deity could be thought of as a human being, lion, tree or any other form. Once this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities. \nBecause the deities were special, these images of the deity were often placed within special homes, places that we describe as temples. You will learn more about these temples in Chapter 12. Bhakti inspired some of the best expressions in art \u2014 sculpture, poetry and architecture. \nBhakti Comes from the Sanskrit term bhaj meaning \u2018to divide or share.\u2019 This suggests an intimate, two-way relationship between the deity and the devotee. Bhakti is directed towards Bhagavat, which is often translated as god, but also means one who possesses and shares bhaga, literally good fortune or bliss. The devotee, known as the bhakta or the bhagavata, shares his or her chosen deity\u2019s bhaga. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After \n\n In March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have given lengthy names for the time that we are studying. They call the earliest period the Palaeolithic. This comes from two Greek words, \u2018palaeo\u2019, meaning old, and \u2018lithos\u2019, meaning stone. The name points to the importance of finds of stone tools. The Palaeolithic period extends from 2 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago. This long stretch of time is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This long span of time covers 99% of human history. \nThe period when we find environmental changes, beginning about 12,000 years ago till about 10,000 years ago is called the Mesolithic (middle stone). Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are called microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or wood to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older varieties of tools continued to be in use. \nThe next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nFind Inamgaon on Map 2 (page14). It is a site on the river Ghod, a tributary of the Bhima. It was occupied between 3600 and 2700 years ago. Here, adults were generally buried in the ground, laid out straight, with the head towards the north. Sometimes burials were within the houses. Vessels that probably contained food and water were placed with the dead. \nOne man was found buried in a large, four legged clay jar in the courtyard of a five-roomed house (one of the largest houses at the site), in the centre of the settlement. This house also had a granary. The body was placed in a crosslegged position. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors contributed to the indigo ryots' decision to launch the \"Blue Rebellion\" in March 1859, and what were the immediate governmental actions taken in response to the spreading rebellion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that the indigo ryots' decision to rebel stemmed from several factors. Firstly, they felt they had the support of local zamindars and village headmen, who were themselves unhappy with the planters' increasing power and being forced to give land on long leases. Secondly, the indigo peasants imagined that the British government would support them, an idea bolstered by the Lieutenant Governor's tour and Magistrate Ashley Eden's notice, which was misinterpreted as a declaration against indigo cultivation. In response to the spreading rebellion, the government took immediate actions. It brought in the military to protect the planters from assault and established the Indigo Commission to investigate the indigo production system. The Commission subsequently found the planters guilty of coercive methods, deemed indigo production unprofitable for ryots, and advised ryots that they could refuse to produce indigo in the future after fulfilling existing contracts.\n\nAnswer: The indigo ryots were empowered to rebel by the perceived support of local zamindars and village headmen, who were discontent with the planters' growing influence, and by the imagined support of the British government, influenced by official tours and notices. In response, the government deployed the military to protect planters and formed the Indigo Commission, which criticized planters for coercive methods, declared indigo production unprofitable for ryots, and allowed ryots to refuse future indigo contracts."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.2.7", "6.5.9", "6.10.8", "6.11.9", "8.3.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Rome on Map 6 (page 84).

Rome was the capital of one of the largest empires \u2014 one that spread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Augustus, one of the most important emperors, who ruled about 2000 years ago, said that he found Rome a city of brick, and made it into a city of marble. He, and later rulers, built temples and palaces. \nThey also built huge amphitheatres \u2014 open arenas surrounded by tiers of seats \u2014 where citizens could watch all kinds of shows, and public baths (with separate timings for men and women), where people met and relaxed. Huge aqueducts \u2014 channels to supply water \u2014 were built to bring water to the city \u2014 for the baths, fountains and toilets. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIn Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Take a look at Table 1 again and identify the five dynasties that together made the Delhi Sultanate. \nThe rulers of Delhi - Table 1 - RAJPUT DYNASTIES : Tomaras Early twelfth century-1165, Ananga Pala 1130-1145, Chauhans 1165-1192, Prithviraj Chauhan 1175-1192 - EARLY TURKISH RULERS 1206-1290 : Qutbuddin Aybak 1206-1210, Shamsuddin Iltutmish 1210-1236, Raziyya 1236-1240, Ghiyasuddin Balban 1266-1287 - KHALJI DYNASTY 1290-1320 : Jalaluddin Khalji 1290-1296, Alauddin Khalji 1296-1316 - TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 1320-1414 : Ghiyasuddin Tughluq 1320-1324, Muhammad Tughluq 1324-1351, Firuz Shah Tughluq 1351-1388 - SAYYID DYNASTY 1414-1451 : Khizr Khan 1414-1421 - LODI DYNASTY 1451-1526 : Bahlul Lodi 1451-1489 \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nCaste and Social Reform \n\n Some of the social reformers we have been discussing also criticised caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy translated an old Buddhist text that was critical of caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of Bhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes. In Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in 1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these reformers and members of reform associations were people of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these reformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch, in an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in their lives. \nThere were also others who questioned the injustices of the caste social order. During the course of the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries began setting up schools for tribal groups and \u201clower\u201d-caste children. These children were thus equipped with some resources to make their way into a changing world. \nAt the same time, the poor began leaving their villages to look for jobs that were opening up in the cities. There was work in the factories that were coming up, and jobs in municipalities. You have read about the expansion of cities in Chapter 6. Think of the new demands of labour this created. Drains had to be dug, roads laid, buildings constructed, and cities cleaned. This required coolies, diggers, carriers, bricklayers, sewage cleaners, sweepers, palanquin bearers, rickshaw pullers. Where did this labour come from? The poor from the villages and small towns, many of them from low castes, began moving to the cities where there was a new demand for labour. Some also went to work in plantations in Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad and Indonesia. Work in the new locations was often very hard. But the poor, the people from low castes, saw this as an opportunity to get away from the oppressive hold that upper-caste landowners exercised over their lives and the daily humiliation they suffered. \nThere were other jobs too. The army, for instance, offered opportunities. A number of Mahar people, who were regarded as untouchable, found jobs in the Mahar Regiment. The father of B.R. Ambedkar, the leader of the Dalit movement, taught at an army school. \nDemands for equality and justice \n Gradually, by the second half of the nineteenth century, people from within the Non-Brahman castes began organising movements against caste discrimination, and demanded social equality and justice. \nThe Satnami movement in Central India was founded by Ghasidas who worked among the leatherworkers and organised a movement to improve their social status. In eastern Bengal, Haridas Thakur\u2019s Matua sect worked among Chandala cultivators. Haridas questioned Brahmanical texts that supported the caste system. In what is present-day Kerala, a guru from Ezhava caste, Shri Narayana Guru, proclaimed the ideals of unity for his people. He argued against treating people unequally on the basis of caste differences. According to him, all humankind belonged to the same caste. One of his famous statements was: \u201coru jati, oru matam, oru daivam manushyanu\u201d (one caste, one religion, one god for humankind). \nAll these sects were founded by leaders who came from Non-Brahman castes and worked amongst them. They tried to change those habits and practices which provoked the contempt of dominant castes. They tried to create a sense of self-esteem among the subordinate castes. \nGulamgiri \n One of the most vocal amongst the \u201clow-caste\u201d leaders was Jyotirao Phule. Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up by Christian missionaries. On growing up he developed his own ideas about the injustices of caste society. He set out to attack the Brahmans\u2019 claim that they were superior to others, since they were Aryans. Phule argued that the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside the subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true children of the country \u2013 those who had lived here from before the coming of the Aryans. As the Aryans established their dominance, they began looking at the defeated population as inferior, as low-caste people. According to Phule, the \u201cupper\u201d castes had no right to their land and power: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people, the so-called low castes. \nPhule claimed that before Aryan rule there existed a golden age when warrior-peasants tilled the land and ruled the Maratha countryside in just and fair ways. He proposed that Shudras (labouring castes) and Ati Shudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste discrimination. The Satyashodhak Samaj, an association Phule founded, propagated caste equality. \nIn 1873, Phule wrote a book named Gulamgiri, meaning slavery. Some ten years before this, the American Civil War had been fought, leading to the end of slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves, thus establishing a link between the conditions of the \u201clower\u201d castes in India and the black slaves in America. \nAs this example shows, Phule extended his criticism of the caste system to argue against all forms of inequality. He was concerned about the plight of \u201cupper\u201d-caste women, the miseries of the labourer, and the humiliation of the \u201clow\u201d castes. This movement for caste reform was continued in the twentieth century by other great dalit leaders like Dr B.R. Ambedkar in western India and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in the south. \nWho could enter temples? \n Ambedkar was born into a Mahar family. As a child he experienced what caste prejudice meant in everyday life. In school he was forced to sit outside the classroom on the ground, and was not allowed to drink water from taps that upper -caste children used. After finishing school, he got a fellowship to go to the US for higher studies. On his return to India in 1919, he wrote extensively about \u201cupper\u201d- caste power in contemporary society. \nIn 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry movement, in which his Mahar caste followers participated. Brahman priests were outraged when the Dalits used water from the temple tank. Ambedkar led three such movements for temple entry between 1927 and 1935. His aim was to make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society. \nThe Non-Brahman movement \n In the early twentieth century, the non-Brahman movement started. The initiative came from those non-Brahman castes that had acquired access to education, wealth and influence. They argued that Brahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the north who had conquered southern lands from the original inhabitants of the region \u2013 the indigenous Dravidian races. They also challenged Brahmanical claims to power. \nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he was called, came from a middle-class family. Interestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early life and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully. Later, he became a member of the Congress, only to leave it in disgust when he found that at a feast organised by nationalists, seating arrangements followed caste distinctions \u2013 that is, the lower castes were made to sit at a distance from the upper castes. Convinced that untouchables had to fight for their dignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement. He argued that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt that all religious authorities saw social divisions and inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to free themselves, therefore, from all religions in order to achieve social equality. \nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures, especially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver, and the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said that these texts had been used to establish the authority of Brahmans over lower castes and the domination of men over women. \nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The forceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-caste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self-criticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. But orthodox Hindu society also reacted by founding Sanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal in the north, and associations like the Brahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these associations was to uphold caste distinctions as a cornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was sanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over caste continued beyond the colonial period and are still going on in our own times. \nOrganising for reform \n The Brahmo Samaj \n The Brahmo Samaj, formed in 1830, prohibited all forms of idolatry and sacrifice, believed in the Upanishads, and forbade its members from criticising other religious practices. It critically drew upon the ideals of religions \u2013 especially of Hinduism and Christianity \u2013 looking at their negative and positive dimensions. \nDerozio and Young Bengal \n Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the 1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all authority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked tradition and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned for the freedom of thought and expression. \nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda \n Named after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s guru, the Ramakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service and selfless action. \nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra Nath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his well founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world. After hearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the New York Herald reported, \u201cWe feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation\u201d. Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in modern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the Vedanta philosophy on a global scale. But his mission was not simply to talk of religion. He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery of his country men. He firmly believed that any reform could become successful only by uplifting the condition of the masses. Therefore, his clarion call to the people of India was to rise above the narrow confines of their \u2018religion of the kitchen\u2019 and come together in the service of the nation. By sending out this call he made a signal contribution to the nascent nationalism of India. His sense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception. He was convinced that many of the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the nations of the world come together on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth was to unite on the basis of a common spiritual heritage. In this exhortation he became truly \u2018the symbol of a new spirit and a source of strength for the future\u2019. \nThe Prarthana Samaj \n Established in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, abolish child marriage, encourage the education of women, and end the ban on widow remarriage. Its religious meetings drew upon Hindu, Buddhist and Christian texts. \nThe Veda Samaj \n Established in Madras (Chennai) in 1864, the Veda Samaj was inspired by the Brahmo Samaj. It worked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women\u2019s education. Its members believed in one God. They condemned the superstitions and rituals of orthodox Hinduism. \nThe Aligarh Movement \n The Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, founded by Sayyid Ahmed Khan in 1875 at Aligarh, later became the Aligarh Muslim University. The institution offered modern education, including Western science, to Muslims. The Aligarh Movement, as it was known, had an enormous impact in the area of educational reform. \nThe Singh Sabha Movement \n Reform organisations of the Sikhs, the first Singh Sabhas were formed at Amritsar in 1873 and at Lahore in 1879. The Sabhas sought to rid Sikhism of superstitions, caste distinctions and practices seen by them as non-Sikh. They promoted education among the Sikhs, often combining modern instruction with Sikh teachings. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, outline the core arguments and actions of Jyotirao Phule, B.R.

He argued that the land rightfully belonged to these indigenous groups. Phule advocated for the unity of Shudras and Ati Shudras to combat caste discrimination and founded the Satyashodhak Samaj to promote caste equality. His 1873 book, 'Gulamgiri,' explicitly linked the conditions of 'lower' castes in India to the black slaves in America, dedicating it to those who fought for slave freedom. He also extended his criticism to all forms of inequality.\n2.  **B.R. Ambedkar:** The text states that B.R. Ambedkar, from a Mahar family, personally experienced caste prejudice. He initiated a temple entry movement in 1927, involving his Mahar caste followers, and led three such movements between 1927 and 1935. His objective was to expose and make visible the pervasive power of caste prejudices within society.\n3.  **E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar):** According to the text, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement after observing caste distinctions at a nationalist feast, which led him to leave the Congress. He contended that untouchables were the true preservers of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture that had been subjugated by Brahmans. Periyar argued that to achieve social equality, untouchables must liberate themselves from all religions, as religious authorities often portrayed social divisions and inequality as divinely ordained. He was also a vocal critic of Hindu scriptures, such as the Codes of Manu, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Ramayana, believing they were used to uphold the authority of Brahmans over lower castes and men over women.\n\nAnswer: Jyotirao Phule argued that Brahmans were foreign Aryan invaders who subjugated the indigenous 'low-caste' people, to whom the land rightfully belonged. He advocated for Shudra and Ati Shudra unity, founded the Satyashodhak Samaj for caste equality, and in his book 'Gulamgiri,' drew parallels between Indian lower castes and American slaves. B.R. Ambedkar, experiencing caste prejudice himself, led three temple entry movements between 1927 and 1935 for his Mahar caste followers to highlight caste prejudices. E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar) founded the Self Respect Movement, contending that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Dravidian culture subjugated by Brahmans. He believed untouchables needed to abandon religion to achieve social equality, criticizing Hindu scriptures for reinforcing Brahmanical and male dominance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.2.9", "7.3.1", "8.8.3", "6.7.8", "6.9.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

At that time a new international body \u2013 the United Nations \u2013 formed in 1945 was in its infancy.The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of the Cold War, that is, power rivalries and ideological conflicts between the USA and the USSR, with both countries creating military alliances. This was also the period when colonial empires were collapsing and many countries were attaining independence. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was also the foreign minister of newly independent India, developed free India\u2019s foreign policy in this context. Non-alignment formed the bedrock of this foreign policy. \nLed by statesmen from Egypt, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Ghana and India, the non-aligned movement urged countries not to join either of the two major alliances. But this policy of staying away from alliances was not a matter of remaining \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d. The former means remaining aloof from world affairs whereas non-aligned countries such as India played an active role in mediating between the American and Soviet alliances. They tried to prevent war \u2014 often taking a humanitarian and moral stand against war. However, for one reason or another, many non-aligned countries including India got involved in wars. By the 1970s, a large number of countries had joined the non-aligned movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nContemporary historians and travellers give very scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAround 3500 years ago, we find some of the first evidence of writing in China. \nThese writings were on animal bones. These are called oracle bones, because they were used to predict the future. Kings got scribes to write questions on the bones \u2014 would they win battles? Would the harvest be good? Would they have sons? The bones were then put into the fire, and they cracked because of the heat. Then fortunetellers studied these cracks, and tried to predict the future. As you may expect, they sometimes made mistakes. \nThese kings lived in palaces in cities. They amassed vast quantities of wealth, including large, elaborately decorated bronze vessels. However, they did not know the use of iron. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After \n\n In March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare the primary motivations that led to the 'Blue Rebellion' of indigo ryots and Birsa Munda's movement, and outline the British government's initial and subsequent responses to each uprising."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify motivations for the Blue Rebellion**: The text 'The \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After' states that ryots refused to grow indigo due to the 'intensely oppressive' indigo system, including refusing to pay rents and being bullied by planters\u2019 lathiyals. They were also motivated by perceived support from local zamindars, village headmen, and the British government. They swore they would no longer take advances for indigo. \n2. **Identify motivations for Birsa Munda's movement**: The text 'A Closer Look (Birsa Munda)' explains that Birsa's movement aimed at 'reforming tribal society' by urging Mundas to give up liquor, clean villages, and stop believing in witchcraft. Politically, it sought to 'drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head,' recovering a 'glorious past' and fighting against the destruction of traditional land systems and cultural criticism by outside forces (dikus and Europeans).\n3. **Identify British response to Blue Rebellion**: The text mentions the British government 'brought in the military to protect the planters' and 'set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system.' The Commission 'held the planters guilty' and declared that ryots 'could refuse to produce indigo in future.'\n4. **Identify British response to Birsa Munda's movement**: The text states that British officials 'arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years.' After his release, he continued to rouse people. Although the movement faded after Birsa\u2019s death, it 'forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus.'\n\nAnswer: The primary motivations for the 'Blue Rebellion' stemmed from the intensely oppressive indigo system, which included forced indigo cultivation, refusal to pay rents, and bullying by planters' lathiyals. The ryots felt empowered by the perceived support of local zamindars, village headmen, and even the British government, swearing to no longer take advances. Birsa Munda's movement was driven by a desire to reform tribal society, urging Mundas to abandon negative practices like drinking liquor and believing in witchcraft, and to recover their glorious past. Politically, it aimed to establish a Munda Raj by driving out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the British government, whom they saw as destroying their traditional land system and way of life.\n\nThe British government responded to the 'Blue Rebellion' by deploying the military to protect planters and by setting up the Indigo Commission. The Commission ultimately held planters guilty, criticized their coercive methods, and permitted ryots to refuse future indigo production. In contrast, British officials responded to Birsa Munda's movement by arresting Birsa in 1895, convicting him of rioting, and jailing him for two years. Although the movement faded after Birsa's death, it eventually compelled the colonial government to introduce laws preventing the easy takeover of tribal land by outsiders."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.3.3", "6.5.11", "8.10.5", "7.7.3", "8.4.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia.

Magadha became the most important mahajanapada in about two hundred years. Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies (c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest, could be captured and trained for the army. Forests also provided wood for building houses, carts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore mines in the region that could be tapped to make strong tools and weapons. \nMagadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible means to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma Nanda was another important ruler. He extended his control up to the north-west part of the subcontinent. Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in Bihar was the capital of Magadha for several years.

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily.

Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.

(3) These authors advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared by everybody. \nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmish\u2019s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. She was removed from the throne in 1240. \nBirthright - Privileges claimed on account of birth. For example, people believed that nobles inherited their rights to govern, because they were born in certain families. Gender distinctions - Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women. \nWhat Minhaj-i Siraj thought about Raziyya? Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore asked: \u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi (1262- 1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in Kashmir (980- 1003). Her title is interesting: it comes from \u201cdidi\u201d or \u201celder sister\u201d, an obviously affectionate term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFallow \u2013 A field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility. Sal \u2013 A tree. Mahua \u2013 A flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol. Bewar \u2013 A term used in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation. \nHow Did Tribal Groups Live? \n\n By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities. Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did rulers and external powers described in the texts seek to establish or maintain their authority, and what perspectives did contemporary chroniclers offer regarding ideal governance and social order?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Legitimization through religious institutions (Section 1):** The text explains that King Anantavarman of the Ganga dynasty erected a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri, and later King Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself its 'deputy.' This demonstrates rulers using religious traditions and institutions to legitimize their authority. Furthermore, conquerors of Orissa, including the Mughals, the Marathas, and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the Jagannatha temple because they believed it 'would make their rule acceptable to the local people.'\n2. **Chronicler's perspective on ideal governance (Section 3):** The authors of tawarikh, who were learned men, advised rulers on 'governance, emphasising the importance of just rule.' Fakhr-i Mudabbir's 'circle of justice' illustrates this, stating that kings cannot survive without soldiers, who need salaries from peasant revenue, and peasants can pay only when 'prosperous and happy,' which happens when the king 'promotes justice and honest governance.'\n3. **Chronicler's perspective on social order and challenges to authority (Section 3):** These tawarikh authors also 'advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions.' The chronicler Minhaj-i Siraj exemplifies this by expressing discomfort with Sultan Raziyya's rule, despite acknowledging her ability, because he believed 'the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men.' This highlights an ideological challenge to a ruler who did not fit the prescribed social order.\n\nAnswer: Rulers like Anantavarman and Anangabhima III established their authority by erecting temples and dedicating their kingdoms to deities like Purushottama Jagannatha, thereby integrating with and elevating religious traditions. External powers, such as the Mughals, Marathas, and the English East India Company, sought control over the Jagannatha temple to make their rule acceptable to the local populace. Contemporary chroniclers, particularly the authors of tawarikh, advised rulers on achieving ideal governance through 'just rule' and 'honest governance,' as articulated in the 'circle of justice.' They also advocated for preserving an 'ideal social order based on birthright and gender distinctions,' with figures like Minhaj-i Siraj expressing discomfort and ideological opposition to female rulers like Raziyya, who challenged this established social order."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.9.3", "8.4.2", "7.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe can catch an occasional glimpse of the lives of ordinary people from plays, and other accounts. Let us look at some of these. \nKalidasa is known for his plays depicting life in the king\u2019s court. An interesting feature about these plays is that the king and most brahmins are shown as speaking Sanskrit, while women and men other than the king and brahmins use Prakrit. His most famous play, Abhijnana Shakuntalam, is the story of the love between a king named Dushyanta and a young woman named Shakuntala. We find an interesting description of the plight of a poor fisherman in this play. \nThe Chinese pilgrim Fa Xian noticed the plight of those who were treated as untouchables by the high and mighty. They were expected to live on the outskirts of the city. He writes: \u201cIf such a man enters a town or a market place, he strikes a piece of wood, in order to keep himself separate; people, hearing this sound, know what it means and avoid touching him or brushing against him.\u201d \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How do the observations of ordinary people and marginalized groups, such as the poor fisherman in Kalidasa's play or the untouchables noted by Fa Xian, relate to the evolving focus of historical studies as described in the second text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text provides specific examples of observations about ordinary people and marginalized groups: the 'plight of a poor fisherman' in Kalidasa's play and Fa Xian's account of 'those who were treated as untouchables' and their living conditions. The second text discusses a shift in historical focus, moving away from solely recording 'battles and big events' and the lives of 'rulers and their policies' to looking at 'how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed.' It explicitly states that historians now write about 'a host of other issues, and other questions' and that 'the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society' need to be considered. Therefore, the observations from the first text are precisely the kind of insights into the lives of ordinary people and social structures that align with the broader, more inclusive approach to history advocated in the second text, which seeks to understand society beyond just the elite.\n\nAnswer: The observations of the poor fisherman in Kalidasa's play and the untouchables by Fa Xian exemplify the shift in historical studies towards understanding the lives of ordinary people, their livelihoods, and social structures, rather than solely focusing on rulers, battles, or political events.

As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLarge states like those of the Cholas (Chapter 2), Tughluqs (Chapter 3) or Mughals (Chapter 4) encompassed many regions. A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that are similar and circle those that are different. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did pan-regional forces, both religious and political, interact with existing regional distinctiveness in the Indian subcontinent, according to the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Analyze the impact of religious pan-regional forces on regional distinctiveness (First Text):** The first text indicates that as people were brought together, the worship of supreme deities like Shiva, Vishnu, and Durga became widespread. Gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas 'came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga,' and 'local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories.' Furthermore, 'methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults.' This demonstrates a process where local religious distinctiveness was integrated into, and shaped by, broader pan-regional religious frameworks, leading to a blending and absorption rather than complete eradication. The widespread popularity of bhakti, adopted even by Buddhists and Jainas, also points to a unifying religious force impacting diverse regions.\n2.  **Analyze the impact of political pan-regional forces on regional distinctiveness (Second Text):** The second text describes the emergence of pan-regional empires like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs, and Mughals that 'encompassed many regions.' It notes that 'years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions,' resulting in 'legacies of the big and small states' and 'many distinct and shared traditions' in governance, economy, elite cultures, and language. However, the text explicitly states that these regions 'felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness.' It highlights that by 700, many regions already possessed 'distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics,' and Amir Khusrau's observations in 1318 further confirm the persistence of a different language in every region.\n3.  **Synthesize the interaction:** Both religious and political pan-regional forces led to significant integration and the development of shared traditions across the subcontinent. In religion, local elements were often absorbed into or identified with larger Puranic narratives. In politics, empires created common legacies. Crucially, in both scenarios, the texts emphasize that regions retained their inherent distinctiveness, whether through persistent local myths within broader religious narratives or through distinct languages and cultural characteristics that coexisted with pan-regional imperial influences.\n\nAnswer: Pan-regional religious forces integrated local deities and myths into broader Puranic traditions and spread unifying beliefs like bhakti, thereby shaping and absorbing regional religious distinctiveness. Concurrently, pan-regional empires created shared legacies in governance, economy, and culture across diverse regions. Despite these powerful integrating forces, the regions consistently retained their fundamental distinctiveness, including unique languages and cultural characteristics, indicating an interaction of integration and shared traditions without a complete loss of regional identity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.8.2", "7.1.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThis was also the time when Aryabhata, a mathematician and astronomer, wrote a book in Sanskrit known as the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis, even though it seems as if the sun is rising and setting everyday. He developed a scientific explanation for eclipses as well. He also found a way of calculating the circumference of a circle, which is nearly as accurate as the formula we use today. Varahamihira, Brahmagupta and Bhaskaracharya were some other mathematicians and astronomers who made several discoveries. Try and find out more about them. \nWhile numerals had been used earlier, mathematicians in India now invented a special symbol for zero. This system of counting was adapted by the Arabs and then spread to Europe. It continues to be in use throughout the world. The Romans used a system of counting without using zero. Try and find out more about it. \nAyurveda is a well-known system of health science that was developed in ancient India. The two famous practitioners of Ayurveda in ancient India were Charaka (1st-2nd centuries C.E.) and Sushruta (c. 4th century C.E.) Charak Samhita, written by Charak is a remarkable book on medicine. In his treatise, Susruta Samhita, Sushruta speaks about elaborate surgical procedures. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago. He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the distinct features of Mahayana Buddhism that contributed to its spread, and how did a significant mathematical innovation from ancient India similarly spread its influence globally?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section details that Mahayana Buddhism developed with two distinct features: the creation of statues of the Buddha (instead of symbolic representations) and the belief in Bodhisattvas.

The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth.

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nVikram Samvat The era beginning in the 58 BCE is traditionally associated with Gupta king, Chandragupta II, who had founded it as a mark of victory over the Shakas and assumed the title of Vikramaditya.

Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwara. \nBefore his death in 1539, Baba Guru Nanak appointed one of his followers as his successor. His name was Lehna but he came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that he was a part of Baba Guru Nanak himself. Guru Angad compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur\u2019s son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as \u2018a state within the state\u2019. The Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement. The ideas of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this development from the very beginning. He emphasised the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications. This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHow Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives? \n\n The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nTraditional food habits are generally based on locally available items of food. Bengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish.

For tribal chiefs, the text states that they 'lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India.' They 'had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British,' ultimately losing 'the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people.' While they were 'allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands,' their traditional functions were curtailed. Regarding shifting cultivators, the British 'wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators' to ease control and ensure 'a regular revenue source.' They 'introduced land settlements' to measure land, define rights, and fix revenue. However, 'the British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful' because 'settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry,' leading to 'poor yields' and suffering for cultivators. Facing 'widespread protests,' the British eventually 'had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest.'\n\nAnswer: Under British colonial rule, tribal chiefs lost significant administrative power, were compelled to adhere to British laws, pay tribute, and discipline their own people on behalf of the British, thus losing their traditional authority, although they retained land titles. Jhum (shifting) cultivators were pressured by the British to settle down for easier administration and consistent revenue through land settlements. However, this policy largely failed because settled plough cultivation was unsuitable for their dry, water-scarce lands, resulting in poor yields. Due to widespread protests, the British were eventually forced to permit shifting cultivation in certain forest areas."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.3", "7.8.11", "7.9.9"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster.

Making silk is a complicated process. Raw silk has to be extracted from the cocoons of silk worms, spun into thread and then woven into cloth. Techniques of making silk were first invented in China around 7000 years ago. While the methods remained a closely guarded secret for thousands of years, some people from China who went to distant lands on foot, horseback, and on camels, carried silk with them. The paths they followed came to be known as the Silk Route. \nSometimes, Chinese rulers sent gifts of silk to rulers in Iran and west Asia, and from there, the knowledge of silk spread further west. About 2000 years ago, wearing silk became the fashion amongst rulers and rich people in Rome. It was very expensive, as it had to be brought all the way from China, along dangerous roads, through mountains and deserts. People living along the route often demanded payments for allowing traders to pass through. \nLook at Map 6 (pages 84-85) which shows the Silk Route and its branches. Some kings tried to control large portions of the route. This was because they could benefit from taxes, tributes and gifts that were brought by traders travelling along the route. In return, they often protected the traders who passed through their kingdoms from attacks by robbers. \nThe best-known of the rulers who controlled the Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over central Asia and north-west India around 2000 years ago. Their two major centres of power were Peshawar and Mathura. Taxila was also included in their kingdom. During their rule, a branch of the Silk Route extended from Central Asia down to the seaports at the mouth of the river Indus, from where silk was shipped westwards to the Roman Empire. The Kushanas were amongst the earliest rulers of the subcontinent to issue gold coins. These were used by traders along the Silk Route. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What was the role of the Kushanas in relation to the Silk Route?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that 'The best-known of the rulers who controlled the Silk Route were the Kushanas'.

Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement. During the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed to women\u2019s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe also have archaeological evidence for crafts.

We know from texts that the manufacture of cloth was important. There were famous centres such as Varanasi in the north, and Madurai in the south. Both men and women worked in these centres. \nMany crafts persons and merchants now formed associations known as shrenis.

How well has the country done in this time? And to what extent has it fulfilled the ideals set out in its Constitution? \nThat India is still united, and that it is still democratic, are achievements that we might justly be proud of. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country, that it would break up into many parts, with each region or linguistic group seeking to form a nation of its own. Others believed that it would come under military rule. However, as many as thirteen general elections have been held since Independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections. There is a free press, as well as an independent judiciary.Finally, the fact that people speak different languages or practise different faiths has not come in the way of national unity. \nOn the other hand, deep divisions persist. Despite constitutional guarantees, the Untouchables or, as they are now referred to, the Dalits, face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks and otherpublic places. And despite the secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution, there have been clashes between different religious groups in many states. Above all, as many observers have noted, the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development. They live in large houses and dine in expensive restaurants, send their children to expensive private schools and take expensive foreign holidays. At the same time many others continue to live below the poverty line. Housed in urban slums, or living in remote villages on lands that yield little, they cannot afford to send their children to school. \nThe Constitution recognises equality before the law, but in real life some Indians are more equal than others. Judged by the standards it set itself at Independence, the Republic of India has not been a great success. But it has not been a failure either. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nNomadic pastoralists moved over long distances with their animals. They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe sword of Tipu Sultan and Wootz steel \n\n We begin the story of Indian steel and iron metallurgy by recounting the famous story of Tipu Sultan who ruled Mysore till 1799, fought four wars with the British and died fighting with his sword in his hand. Tipu\u2019s legendary swords are now part of valuable collections in museums in England. But do you know why the sword was so special? The sword had an incredibly hard and sharp edge that could easily rip through the opponent\u2019s armour. This quality of the sword came from a special type of high carbon steel called Wootz which was produced all over south India. Wootz steel when made into swords produced a very sharp edge with a flowing water pattern. This pattern came from very small carbon crystals embedded in the iron. \nFrancis Buchanan who toured through Mysore in 1800, a year after Tipu Sultan\u2019s death, has left us an account of the technique by which Wootz steel was produced in many hundreds of smelting furnaces in Mysore. In these furnaces, iron was mixed with charcoal and put inside small clay pots. Through an intricate control of temperatures the smelters produced steel ingots that were used for sword making not just in India but in West and Central Asia too. Wootz is an anglicised version of the Kannada word ukku, Telugu hukku and Tamil and Malayalam urukku \u2013 meaning steel. \nIndian Wootz steel fascinated European scientists. Michael Faraday, the legendary scientist and discoverer of electricity and electromagnetism, spent four years studying the properties of Indian Wootz (1818-22). However, the Wootz steel making process, which was so widely known in south India, was completely lost by the mid-nineteenth century. Can you guess why this was so? The swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India. \nAbandoned furnaces in villages \n Production of Wootz steel required a highly specialised technique of refining iron. But iron smelting in India was extremely common till the end of the nineteenth century. In Bihar and Central India, in particular, every district had smelters that used local deposits of ore to produce iron which was widely used for the manufacture of implements and tools of daily use. The furnaces were most often built of clay and sun-dried bricks. The smelting was done by men while women worked the bellows, pumping air that kept the charcoal burning. \nBy the late nineteenth century, however, the craft of iron smelting was in decline. In most villages, furnaces fell into disuse and the amount of iron produced came down. Why was this so? One reason was the new forest laws that you have read about (Chapter 4). When the colonial government prevented people from entering the reserved forests, how could the iron smelters find wood for charcoal? Where could they get iron ore? Defying forest laws, they often entered the forests secretly and collected wood, but they could not sustain their occupation on this basis for long. Many gave up their craft and looked for other means of livelihood. \nIn some areas the government did grant access to the forest. But the iron smelters had to pay a very high tax to the forest department for every furnace they used. This reduced their income. Moreover, by the late nineteenth century iron and steel was being imported from Britain. Ironsmiths in India began using the imported iron to manufacture utensils and implements. This inevitably lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters. By the early twentieth century, the artisans producing iron and steel faced a new competition. \nIron and steel factories come up in India \n The year was 1904. In the hot month of April, Charles Weld, an American geologist and Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of Jamsetji Tata, were travelling in Chhattisgarh in search of iron ore deposits. They had spent many months on a costly venture looking for sources of good iron ore to set up a modern iron and steel plant in India. Jamsetji Tata had decided to spend a large part of his fortune to build a big iron and steel industry in India. But this could not be done without identifying the source of fine quality iron ore. \nOne day, after travelling for many hours in the forests, Weld and Dorabji came upon a small village and found a group of men and women carrying basketloads of iron ore. These people were the Agarias. When asked where they had found the iron ore, the Agarias pointed to a hill in the distance. Weld and Dorabji reached the hill after an exhausting trek through dense forests. On exploring the hill the geologist declared that they had at last found what they had been looking for. Rajhara Hills had one of the finest ores in the world. \nBut there was a problem. The region was dry and water \u2013 necessary for running the factory \u2013 was not to be found nearby. The Tatas had to continue their search for a more suitable place to set up their factory. However, the Agarias helped in the discovery of a source of iron ore that would later supply the Bhilai Steel Plant. A few years later a large area of forest was cleared on the banks of the river Subarnarekha to set up the factory and an industrial township \u2013 Jamshedpur. Here there was water near iron ore deposits. The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) that came up began producing steel in 1912. \nTISCO was set up at an opportune time. All through the late nineteenth century, India was importing steel that was manufactured in Britain. Expansion of the railways in India had provided a huge market for rails that Britain produced. For a long while, British experts in the Indian Railways were unwilling to believe that good quality steel could be produced in India. \nBy the time TISCO was set up the situation was changing. In 1914 the First World War broke out. Steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe. So imports of British steel into India declined dramatically and the Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails. As the war dragged on for several years, TISCO had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war. By 1919 the colonial government was buying 90 per cent of the steel manufactured by TISCO. Over time TISCO became the biggest steel industry within the British empire. \nIn the case of iron and steel, as in the case of cotton textiles, industrial expansion occurred only when British imports into India declined and the market for Indian industrial goods increased. This happened during the First World War and after. As the nationalist movement developed and the industrial class became stronger, the demand for government protection became louder. Struggling to retain its control over India, the British government had to concede many of these demands in the last decades of colonial rule. \nBellows \u2013 A device or equipment that can pump air. \n Slag heaps \u2013 The waste left when smelting metal. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors led to the decline of traditional Wootz steel and iron smelting in India, and what circumstances enabled the establishment and growth of the modern Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The decline of traditional Wootz steel and iron smelting is detailed in the third text section. Wootz steel production was lost by the mid-nineteenth century because the 'swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India.' General iron smelting declined due to 'new forest laws' that restricted access to wood for charcoal and iron ore, and because smelters had to pay 'a very high tax' for furnaces. Additionally, 'iron and steel was being imported from Britain,' which lowered demand for locally produced iron. \n\nThe emergence of a modern steel industry, TISCO, began with Jamsetji Tata's decision to build a large plant. His son Dorabji Tata and Charles Weld found 'fine quality iron ore' at Rajhara Hills with the help of the Agarias. Although this site lacked water, they later found a suitable location on the 'banks of the river Subarnarekha' in Jamshedpur where water was available near ore deposits. TISCO began producing steel in 1912. Its growth was significantly boosted by the 'First World War' (1914). British steel imports 'declined dramatically' as Britain focused on war demands, leading the 'Indian Railways' to turn to TISCO for rails. TISCO also produced 'shells and carriage wheels for the war,' and by 1919, the colonial government was buying '90 per cent of the steel manufactured by TISCO,' making it the 'biggest steel industry within the British empire.'\n\nAnswer: Traditional Wootz steel production declined because the British conquest ended the swords and armour industry, and imports of British steel displaced local craftspeople. General iron smelting declined due to new colonial forest laws restricting access to wood and ore, high taxes on furnaces, and increased imports of cheaper British iron and steel. The modern Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was established after Jamsetji Tata's son, Dorabji Tata, and Charles Weld found high-quality iron ore (with the help of the Agarias) and a suitable location near the Subarnarekha river. TISCO's growth was significantly accelerated by the First World War, which caused a dramatic decline in British steel imports and led the Indian Railways and the colonial government to rely heavily on TISCO for steel, shells, and carriage wheels, making it the largest steel industry in the British empire by 1919."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.10.6", "7.7.4", "8.6.3", "6.10.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Vessels that probably contained food and water were placed with the dead. \nOne man was found buried in a large, four legged clay jar in the courtyard of a five-roomed house (one of the largest houses at the site), in the centre of the settlement. This house also had a granary. The body was placed in a crosslegged position. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons. The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What challenges did the Delhi Sultans face in the early thirteenth century, and what strategies did they employ to consolidate their control and expand their territory?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states several challenges faced by the Delhi Sultans in the early thirteenth century: their control rarely extended beyond heavily fortified garrison towns, they seldom controlled the hinterland and were thus dependent on trade, tribute, or plunder for supplies. They found it extremely difficult to control distant garrison towns like Bengal and Sind due to fragile communication routes susceptible to rebellion, war, or bad weather. Furthermore, their authority was challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at signs of weakness. \n\nTo consolidate and expand their territory, the text outlines the following strategies:\n1.  **Consolidation:** This occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban.\n2.  **Further Expansion:** This took place under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq.\n3.  **Internal Frontier Campaigns:** These campaigns aimed to consolidate the hinterlands of garrison towns.

These campaigns resulted in the capture of elephants, horses, slaves, and precious metals.\n\nAnswer: In the early thirteenth century, the Delhi Sultans faced challenges including limited control beyond fortified garrison towns, dependence on external supplies due to lack of hinterland control, difficulty managing distant garrisons like Bengal and Sind because of fragile communication lines, and threats from Mongol invasions and rebellious governors. To consolidate and expand, they initiated internal frontier campaigns to secure hinterlands by clearing forests, encouraging agriculture, and establishing new towns for trade.

The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor- General (1798-1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. \nTipu Sultan \u2013 The \u201cTiger of Mysore\u201d The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. \nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1781 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close relationship with the French in India, and modernised his army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious, arrogant and dangerous \u2013 rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1787-89, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \nWar with the Marathas \n From the late eighteenth century the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1781, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy \n It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, carried on the resistance. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book. \nIn the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab was annexed. \nThe Doctrine of Lapse \n The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1858. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1858, the Company also took over Awadh. This time the British had an added argument \u2013 they said they were \u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the methods used by Indian chiefs and rulers to establish or expand their power in the seventh and eighth centuries with the strategies employed by the East India Company to annex Indian territories between 1757 and 1858."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first section describes how Indian chiefs and rulers established or expanded power in the seventh and eighth centuries. This involved 'samantas' (subordinates) gaining wealth and power, then asserting independence from their overlords, sometimes by overthrowing them (e.g., Dantidurga of the Rashtrakutas overthrowing the Chalukyas). Legitimacy was sometimes sought through rituals like 'hiranya-garbha'. Additionally, 'men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms' (e.g., Kadamba Mayurasharman and Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra).\n\nThe second section details the East India Company's strategies for territorial expansion. These included 'political, economic and diplomatic methods' such as appointing Residents to interfere in internal affairs (succession, administrative posts) and forcing states into 'subsidiary alliances' where rulers had no independent armed forces and had to pay for Company protection, with territory taken as penalty if payments failed (e.g., Awadh, Hyderabad). The Company also resorted to 'direct military confrontation' when its interests were threatened (e.g., wars with Mysore, Marathas, Sikhs). Later policies included 'paramountcy' (claiming supreme authority to justify annexation) and the 'Doctrine of Lapse' (annexing kingdoms if a ruler died without a male heir, e.g., Satara, Jhansi). Awadh was annexed based on a claim of 'misgovernment', and some annexations were driven by strategic fears (e.g., Sind and Punjab due to fear of Russia).\n\nIn contrast, the Indian chiefs' methods were primarily internal power struggles: subordinates overthrowing overlords, establishing new kingdoms through military skill, and using rituals for social and political legitimacy. The East India Company's approach was a more systematic and multi-faceted imperial strategy involving initial political and economic manipulation, followed by military force, and later employing specific doctrines and pretexts (subsidiary alliance, paramountcy, doctrine of lapse, misgovernment) to progressively annex territories and consolidate control, driven by commercial and strategic interests.\n\nAnswer: In the seventh and eighth centuries, Indian chiefs and rulers expanded power by gaining wealth and asserting independence from overlords, often through military overthrow (like the Rashtrakutas). They also used military skills to establish new kingdoms and performed rituals like 'hiranya-garbha' for legitimacy. The East India Company, between 1757 and 1858, employed a multi-faceted approach including political interference through Residents, imposing 'subsidiary alliances' that disarmed states and demanded payment, and direct military confrontation when interests were threatened. Later, they introduced policies like 'paramountcy' (claiming supreme authority) and the 'Doctrine of Lapse' (annexing states without a male heir), and annexed territories based on claims of 'misgovernment' or strategic fears. The Indian chiefs' methods were largely internal struggles for power and legitimacy, while the Company's were a systematic imperial strategy driven by economic and political control."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.1", "8.2.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red. One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and geometric patterns. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period. At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what defines a 'jati' during the period between 700 and 1750, and what is the literal meaning of 'janapada'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires two definitions from the provided texts.

Different plants grow in different conditions \u2014 rice, for example, requires more water than wheat and barley. This explains why farmers grow some crops in some areas and not in other areas. Different animals too, prefer different environments \u2014 for instance, sheep and goat can survive more easily than cattle in dry, hilly environments. But, as you saw in Chapter 2, women and men did not always produce their own food. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nNomadic pastoralists moved over long distances with their animals. They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants.

Let us look at the history of one dance form, Kathak, now associated with several parts of north India. The term kathak is derived from katha, a word used in Sanskrit and other languages for story. The kathaks were originally a caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who embellished their performances with gestures and songs. Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of dance in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with the spread of the bhakti movement. The legends of Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called rasa lila, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures of the kathak story-tellers. \nUnder the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak was performed in the court, where it acquired its present features and developed into a form of dance with a distinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two traditions or gharanas: one in the courts of Rajasthan (Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow. Under the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into a major art form. By the third quarter of the nineteenth century it was firmly entrenched as a dance form not only in these two regions, but in the adjoining areas of present-day Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Emphasis was laid on intricate and rapid footwork, elaborate costumes, as well as on the enactment of stories. \nKathak, like several other cultural practices, was viewed with disfavour by most British administrators in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it survived and continued to be performed by courtesans, and was recognised as one of six \u201cclassical\u201d forms of dance in the country after independence. \nThe question of defining any art form as \u201cclassical\u201d is often quite complicated. Do we define something as classical if it deals with a religious theme? Or do we consider it classical because it appears to require a great deal of skill acquired through long years of training? Or is it classical because it is performed according to rules that are laid down, and variations are not encouraged? These are questions we need to think about. It is worth remembering that many dance forms that are classified as \u201cfolk\u201d also share several of the characteristics considered typical of \u201cclassical\u201d forms. So, while the use of the term \u201cclassical\u201d may suggest that these forms are superior, this need not always be literally true.

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains. But it was difficult to keep this balance all the time. Look at Table 1 again \u2013 note that Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji when he came to accept Mughal authority. What was the consequence of this insult? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSometimes, megaliths contain more than one skeleton. These indicate that people, perhaps belonging to the same family, were buried in the same place though not at the same time.

People have lived along the banks of this river for several hundred thousand years. Some of the earliest people who lived here were skilled gatherers, \u2014 that is, people who gathered their food. They knew about the vast wealth of plants in the surrounding forests, and collected roots, fruits and other forest produce for their food. They also hunted animals. \nNow find the Sulaiman and Kirthar hills to the northwest. Some of the areas where women and men first began to grow crops such as wheat and barley about 8000 years ago are located here. People also began rearing animals like sheep, goat, and cattle, and lived in villages. Locate the Garo hills to the north-east and the Vindhyas in central India. These were some of the other areas where agriculture developed. The places where rice was first grown are to the north of the Vindhyas. \nTrace the river Indus and its tributaries (tributaries are smaller rivers that flow into a larger river). About 4700 years ago, some of the earliest cities flourished on the banks of these rivers. Later, about 2500 years ago, cities developed on the banks of the Ganga and its tributaries, and along the sea coasts. \nLocate the Ganga and its tributary called the Son. In ancient times the area along these rivers to the south of the Ganga was known as Magadha now lying in the state of Bihar. Its rulers were very powerful, and set up a large kingdom. Kingdoms were set up in other parts of the country as well. \nThroughout, people travelled from one part of the subcontinent to another. The hills and high mountains including the Himalayas, deserts, rivers and seas made journeys dangerous at times, but never impossible. So, men and women moved in search of livelihood, as also to escape from natural disasters like floods or droughts. Sometimes men marched in armies, conquering others\u2019 lands. Besides, merchants travelled with caravans or ships, carrying valuable goods from place to place. And religious teachers walked from village to village, town to town, stopping to offer instruction and advice on the way. Finally, some people perhaps travelled driven by a spirit of adventure, wanting to discover new and exciting places. All these led to the sharing of ideas between people. \nWhy do people travel nowadays? Look at Map 1 once more. Hills, mountains and seas form the natural frontiers of the subcontinent. While it was difficult to cross these frontiers, those who wanted could and did scale the mountains and cross the seas. People from across the frontiers also came into the subcontinent and settled here. \nThese movements of people enriched our cultural traditions. People have shared new ways of carving stone, composing music, and even cooking food over several hundreds of years. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What evidence of human interaction with ostriches from the Palaeolithic period has been found in India, and where was this evidence located?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that 'Ostriches were found in India during the Palaeolithic period.'

Nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, when railway lines were being laid down for the first time in the Punjab, engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in present-day Pakistan. To them, it seemed like a mound that was a rich source of ready made, high quality bricks. So they carried off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the city to build railway lines. Many buildings were completely destroyed. \nThen, about eighty years ago, archaeologists found the site, and realised that this was one of the oldest cities in the subcontinent. As this was the first city to be discovered, all other sites from where similar buildings (and other things) were found were described as Harappan. These cities developed about 4700 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHow Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives? \n\n The lives of tribal groups changed during British rule. Let us see what these changes were. \n What happened to tribal chiefs? \n Before the arrival of the British, in many areas the tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. In some places they had their own police and decided on the local rules of land and forest management. Under British rule, the functions and powers of the tribal chiefs changed considerably. They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India. They also had to pay tribute to the British, and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British. They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions. \nWhat happened to the shifting cultivators? \n The British were uncomfortable with groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home. They wanted tribal groups to settle down and become peasant cultivators. Settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on the move. The British also wanted a regular revenue source for the state. So they introduced land settlements \u2013 that is, they measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state. Some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. As you have seen (Chapter 2), the tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state. \nThe British effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful. Settled plough cultivation is not easy in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry. In fact, jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered, since their fields did not produce good yields. So the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice. Facing widespread protests, the British had to ultimately allow them the right to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest. \nForest laws and their impact \n The life of tribal groups, as you have seen, was directly connected to the forest. So changes in forest laws had a considerable effect on tribal lives. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely, practise jhum cultivation, collect fruits, or hunt animals. How were jhum cultivators to survive in such a situation? Many were therefore forced to move to other areas in search of work and livelihood. \nBut once the British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests, they faced a problem. From where would the Forest Department get its labour to cut trees for railway sleepers and to transport logs? Colonial officials came up with a solution. They decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. So in many regions the Forest Department established forest villages to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour. \nSleeper \u2013 The horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid. \nMany tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws. They disobeyed the new rules, continued with practices that were declared illegal, and at times rose in open rebellion. Such was the revolt of Songram Sangma in 1906 in Assam, and the forest satyagraha of the 1930s in the Central Provinces. \nThe problem with trade During the nineteenth century, tribal groups found that traders and moneylenders were coming into the forests more often, wanting to buy forest produce, offering cash loans, and asking them to work for wages. It took tribal groups some time to understand the consequences of what was happening. \nLet us consider the case of the silk growers. In the eighteenth century, Indian silk was in demand in European markets. The fine quality of Indian silk was highly valued and exports from India increased rapidly. As the market expanded, East India Company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand. \nHazaribagh, in present-day Jharkhand, was an area where the Santhals reared cocoons. The traders dealing in silk sent in their agents who gave loans to the tribal people and collected the cocoons. The growers were paid Rs 3 to Rs 4 for a thousand cocoons. These were then exported to Burdwan or Gaya where they were sold at five times the price. The middlemen \u2013 so called because they arranged deals between the exporters and silk growers \u2013 made huge profits. The silk growers earned very little. Understandably, many tribal groups saw the market and the traders as their main enemies. \nThe search for work \n The plight of the tribals who had to go far away from their homes in search of work was even worse. From the late nineteenth century, tea plantations started coming up and mining became an important industry. Tribals were recruited in large numbers to work the tea plantations of Assam and the coal mines of Jharkhand. They were recruited through contractors who paid them miserably low wages, and prevented them from returning home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the texts, how did the British efforts to build railway infrastructure impact both tribal communities and ancient historical sites?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Impact on Tribal Communities:** The first text, 'How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?', states that the British needed timber for 'railway sleepers'. To address this need for labor to cut trees and transport logs, colonial officials established 'forest villages'. Jhum cultivators were given small patches of land in these villages on the condition that they would provide labor to the Forest Department, thereby impacting their traditional lives by forcing them into specific labor roles for railway infrastructure. \n2.  **Impact on Ancient Historical Sites:** The second text, describing the discovery of Harappa, explains that about 150 years ago, engineers laying down railway lines in Punjab stumbled upon Harappa. They found it to be a 'rich source of ready made, high quality bricks' and consequently 'carried off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the city to build railway lines'. This action led to the complete destruction of many ancient Harappan buildings.\n\nAnswer: The British railway construction efforts impacted tribal communities by coercing jhum cultivators into providing labor for cutting timber for railway sleepers, often through the establishment of 'forest villages'. Simultaneously, ancient historical sites like Harappa suffered significant destruction, as engineers used thousands of bricks from its old buildings to construct railway lines."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.3", "6.4.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Different plants grow in different conditions \u2014 rice, for example, requires more water than wheat and barley. This explains why farmers grow some crops in some areas and not in other areas. Different animals too, prefer different environments \u2014 for instance, sheep and goat can survive more easily than cattle in dry, hilly environments.

They arranged for them to stay together in the sangha, an association of those who left their homes. \nThe rules made for the Buddhist sangha were written down in a book called the Vinaya Pitaka. From this we know that there were separate branches for men and women. All men could join the sangha. However, children had to take the permission of their parents and slaves that of their masters. Those who worked for the king had to take his permission and debtors that of creditors. Women had to take their husbands\u2019 permission. \nMen and women who joined the sangha led simple lives. They meditated for most of the time, and went to cities and villages to beg for food during fixed hours. That is why they were known as bhikkhus (the Prakrit word for renouncer \u2014 beggar) and bhikkhunis. They taught others, and helped one another. They also held meetings to settle any quarrels that took place within the sangha. \nThose who joined the sangha included brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants, labourers, barbers, courtesans and slaves. Many of them wrote down the teachings of the Buddha. Some of them also composed beautiful poems, describing their life in the sangha. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about the past depending upon the period of their study and the nature of their investigation. Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later. The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in large library collections. \nArchive - A place where documents and manuscripts are stored.

How well has the country done in this time? And to what extent has it fulfilled the ideals set out in its Constitution? \nThat India is still united, and that it is still democratic, are achievements that we might justly be proud of. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country, that it would break up into many parts, with each region or linguistic group seeking to form a nation of its own. Others believed that it would come under military rule. However, as many as thirteen general elections have been held since Independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections. There is a free press, as well as an independent judiciary.Finally, the fact that people speak different languages or practise different faiths has not come in the way of national unity. \nOn the other hand, deep divisions persist. Despite constitutional guarantees, the Untouchables or, as they are now referred to, the Dalits, face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks and otherpublic places. And despite the secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution, there have been clashes between different religious groups in many states. Above all, as many observers have noted, the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development. They live in large houses and dine in expensive restaurants, send their children to expensive private schools and take expensive foreign holidays. At the same time many others continue to live below the poverty line. Housed in urban slums, or living in remote villages on lands that yield little, they cannot afford to send their children to school. \nThe Constitution recognises equality before the law, but in real life some Indians are more equal than others. Judged by the standards it set itself at Independence, the Republic of India has not been a great success. But it has not been a failure either. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What significant challenges did historians face when relying on textual records and manuscripts for studying the period from approximately 700 to 1750, and what were the underlying reasons for these difficulties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that during the period from roughly 700 to 1750, textual records and manuscripts provided detailed information but were 'also difficult to use'.

Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After \n\n In March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs the empire was so large, different parts were ruled differently. The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What prompted Mahatma Gandhi's involvement in the Champaran movement, and what was the historical background of indigo cultivation issues that led to such peasant unrest?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text 'The \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After' states that Mahatma Gandhi was persuaded to visit Champaran by a peasant from Bihar to witness the plight of indigo cultivators after his return from South Africa. His visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement. The historical background detailed in the same text describes the 'Blue Rebellion' of March 1859 in Bengal, where ryots refused to grow indigo due to an intensely oppressive system, attacked factories, and boycotted planters. They were supported by local zamindars and village headmen, and believed they had government sympathy. After the Indigo Commission found planters guilty and indigo production collapsed in Bengal, planters shifted their operations to Bihar, continuing the issues that Gandhi later addressed. The text 'The Growth of Mass Nationalism' also confirms Champaran as one of Gandhi's 'earliest interventions' after arriving in India in 1915.\n\nAnswer: Mahatma Gandhi's involvement in the Champaran movement was prompted by a peasant from Bihar who persuaded him to visit in 1917 to see the plight of indigo cultivators, shortly after Gandhi returned from South Africa. The historical background of indigo cultivation issues stemmed from the 'Blue Rebellion' of 1859 in Bengal, where ryots rebelled against the intensely oppressive indigo system, refusing to grow the crop and attacking planters' operations. This rebellion, supported by local leaders, led to the collapse of indigo production in Bengal, causing planters to shift their operations and the associated exploitative practices to Bihar, setting the stage for the Champaran movement."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.3.3", "6.9.6", "8.9.2", "6.8.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Shah Jahan adapt the traditional chahar bagh garden concept and what symbolic architectural features did he integrate into his ceremonial audience halls to project his image as a divine and just ruler?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains Shah Jahan's adaptation of the chahar bagh into the 'riverfront garden' variation.

Magadha became the most important mahajanapada in about two hundred years. Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies (c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest, could be captured and trained for the army. Forests also provided wood for building houses, carts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore mines in the region that could be tapped to make strong tools and weapons. \nMagadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible means to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma Nanda was another important ruler. He extended his control up to the north-west part of the subcontinent. Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in Bihar was the capital of Magadha for several years.

As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe noted earlier the connection between the Tamil bhakti movement and temple worship. This in turn led to a reaction that is best represented in the Virashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and his companions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi. This movement began in Karnataka in the mid-twelfth century. The Virashaivas argued strongly for the equality of all human beings and against Brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of women. They were also against all forms of ritual and idol worship. \nThese are vachanas or sayings attributed to Basavanna: The rich, Will make temples for Shiva. What shall I, A poor man, Do? My legs are pillars, The body the shrine, The head a cupola Of gold. Listen, O Lord of the meeting rivers, Things standing shall fall, But the moving ever shall stay. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nMany of the caves in which these early people lived have paintings on the walls.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did different religious movements challenge the prevailing ideas of social hierarchy and traditional worship practices in ancient and medieval India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section establishes the prevailing ideas of social hierarchy, where 'social privileges came from birth in a 'noble' family or a 'high' caste,' and describes worship through 'elaborate rituals' for supreme deities.

The teachings of the Buddha and the Jainas offered a means to overcome social differences and the cycle of rebirth through personal effort, rather than birthright. The bhakti movement, as it evolved, eventually asserted that devotees could receive God's grace regardless of their caste status.

Even as this was happening, new arts, crafts and production activities flourished in towns and villages. Over the centuries important political, social and economic developments had taken place. But social change was not the same everywhere, because different kinds of societies evolved differently. It is important to understand how, and why, this happened. \nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms. The difference between the high and low, and between the rich and poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about the past depending upon the period of their study and the nature of their investigation. Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later.

It explicitly mentions that 'These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use.' The reason for this difficulty is explained: 'There was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand.' This manual copying process led to 'small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there' being introduced by scribes. Over time, 'These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another.' A significant problem arising from this is that historians 'rarely find the original manuscript of the author today' and are 'totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes.' Therefore, historians 'have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written.' Additionally, the text notes that 'authors revised their chronicles at different times,' adding another layer of complexity for historians.\n\nAnswer: Historians faced primary difficulties with manuscripts for the period 700-1750 because the absence of a printing press meant scribes copied texts by hand, inadvertently introducing small changes. Over centuries, these alterations accumulated, resulting in substantially different versions of the same original text. As original manuscripts are rarely available, historians must compare multiple copied versions to infer the author's original content, a task further complicated by authors sometimes revising their own works."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.1", "7.1.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum Zinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in November 1862. \nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the rebellion died down after that. People continued to resist and battle the British. The British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. Lucknow was taken in March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate awaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, chose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on all sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India and continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of many tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried and killed in April 1859. \nJust as victories against the British had earlier encouraged rebellion, the defeat of rebel forces encouraged desertions. The British also tried their best to win back the loyalty of the people. They announced rewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British, and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied. Nevertheless, hundreds of sepoys, rebels, nawabs and rajas were tried and hanged. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen that the earliest people hunted, gathered plant produce, made stone tools, and painted on cave walls. Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally, fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river. In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nEmperors need more resources than kings because empires are larger than kingdoms, and need to be protected by big armies.

These six systems of philosophy are said to have been founded by sages Konada, Gotama, Kapila, Patanjali, Jaimini and Vyasa, respectively. These philosophies still guide scholarly discourse in the country. German-born British indologist, Friedrich Max Muller, has observed that the six systems of philosophy were developed over many generations with contributions made by individual thinkers.

They arranged for them to stay together in the sangha, an association of those who left their homes. \nThe rules made for the Buddhist sangha were written down in a book called the Vinaya Pitaka. From this we know that there were separate branches for men and women. All men could join the sangha. However, children had to take the permission of their parents and slaves that of their masters. Those who worked for the king had to take his permission and debtors that of creditors. Women had to take their husbands\u2019 permission. \nMen and women who joined the sangha led simple lives. They meditated for most of the time, and went to cities and villages to beg for food during fixed hours. That is why they were known as bhikkhus (the Prakrit word for renouncer \u2014 beggar) and bhikkhunis. They taught others, and helped one another. They also held meetings to settle any quarrels that took place within the sangha. \nThose who joined the sangha included brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants, labourers, barbers, courtesans and slaves. Many of them wrote down the teachings of the Buddha. Some of them also composed beautiful poems, describing their life in the sangha. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe lions that we see on our notes and coins have a long history. They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars. \nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble\u2019s position in court and the larger his salary. \nNobles with a zat of 5,000 were ranked higher than those of 1,000. In Akbar\u2019s reign there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars had increased to 79. \nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary. \nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country. \nIn Akbar\u2019s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb\u2019s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Explain the mansabdari system under the Mughals, detailing its purpose, how rank and salary were determined, and the significant changes in the administration of jagirs from Akbar's to Aurangzeb's reign."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The mansabdari system is described as a grading system used by the Mughals to fix rank, salary, and military responsibilities.

The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThis was also the time when the worship of certain deities, which became a central feature of later Hinduism, gained in importance. These deities included Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as Durga. \nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti, an idea that became very popular at this time. Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti. \nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is included in the Mahabharata (see Chapter 12). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna, his devotee and friend, to abandon all dharmas and take refuge in him, as only he can set Arjuna free from every evil. This form of worship gradually spread to different parts of the country. \nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasised devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices. \nAccording to this system of belief, if a devotee worships the chosen deity with a pure heart, the deity will appear in the form in which he or she may desire. So, the deity could be thought of as a human being, lion, tree or any other form. Once this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities. \nBecause the deities were special, these images of the deity were often placed within special homes, places that we describe as temples. You will learn more about these temples in Chapter 12. Bhakti inspired some of the best expressions in art \u2014 sculpture, poetry and architecture. \nBhakti Comes from the Sanskrit term bhaj meaning \u2018to divide or share.\u2019 This suggests an intimate, two-way relationship between the deity and the devotee. Bhakti is directed towards Bhagavat, which is often translated as god, but also means one who possesses and shares bhaga, literally good fortune or bliss. The devotee, known as the bhakta or the bhagavata, shares his or her chosen deity\u2019s bhaga. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\n8 Women, Caste and Reform \n\n Have you ever thought of how children lived about two hundred years ago?

They have to be adults before they are legally married, and according to law, they can marry anyone they like, from any caste and community, and widows can remarry too. All women, like all men, can vote and stand for elections. Of course, these rights are not actually enjoyed by all. Poor people have little or no access to education, and in many families, women cannot choose their husbands. \nTwo hundred years ago things were very different. Most children were married off at an early age. Both Hindu and Muslim men could marry more than one wife. In some parts of the country, widows were praised if they chose death by burning themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands. Women who died in this manner, whether willingly or otherwise, were called \u201csati\u201d, meaning virtuous women. Women\u2019s rights to property were also restricted. Besides, most women had virtually no access to education. In many parts of the country people believed that if a woman was educated, she would become a widow. \nDifferences between men and women were not the only ones in society. In most regions, people were divided along lines of caste. Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered themselves as \u201cupper castes\u201d.

The 'Hampi' text identifies the Virupaksha temple, dedicated to 'Virupaksha (a form of Shiva),' as a hub of cultural activities where devadasis performed before the deity, royalty, and masses. It also mentions the Mahanavami festival as an important celebration. \n2. The 'Bhakti' text explicitly states that the worship of certain deities, including 'Shiva,' gained importance during the Bhakti movement. It defines Bhakti as 'a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity' and emphasizes 'devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess.' \n3. The 'Bhakti' text also highlights the inclusivity of the movement, stating that 'Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti,' and that images of deities were placed in 'temples.'\n4. Therefore, the presence of the Virupaksha temple dedicated to Shiva in Hampi directly reflects the growing importance of Shiva worship emphasized by the Bhakti movement. While Hampi's description focuses on public performances and cultural activities within the temple, the Bhakti text provides the underlying principle of devotion to a chosen deity and the role of temples as special homes for these deities, aligning Hampi's religious structures with the broader trends of the Bhakti movement.\n\nAnswer: The Virupaksha temple in Hampi, dedicated to Shiva, directly connects with the Bhakti movement's emphasis on the worship of deities like Shiva. Temples in Hampi served as hubs for cultural activities, consistent with the Bhakti movement's practice of housing deities in temples. The Bhakti movement also promoted devotion and individual worship accessible to all, regardless of caste or gender, providing a broader context for the religious landscape in which Hampi's temple practices, including performances by devadasis, existed."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.8", "6.10.9", "8.8.1", "6.10.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The state built numerous rest-houses to take care of the needs of people from all over the world who came to the city. There were magnificent buildings and innumerable pleasure parks. The Kathiawad seths or mahajans (moneychangers) had huge banking houses at Surat. It is noteworthy that the Surat hundis were honoured in the far-off markets of Cairo in Egypt, Basra in Iraq and Antwerp in Belgium. \nHundi is a note recording a deposit made by a person. The amount deposited can be claimed in another place by presenting the record of the deposit. \nHowever, Surat began to decline towards the end of the seventeenth century. This was because of many factors: the loss of markets and productivity because of the decline of the Mughal Empire, control of the sea routes by the Portuguese and competition from Bombay (present-day Mumbai) where the English East India Company shifted its headquarters in 1668. Today, Surat is a bustling commercial centre. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHow did the Cholas rise to power? A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the administrative organization of the Chola kingdom, including the roles of local bodies and prominent groups, the different categories of land, and the functioning and eligibility criteria for members of the sabha (Brahmana assemblies)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The answer is derived by synthesizing information primarily from the 'How did the Cholas rise to power?' section. \n\n1.  **Administrative Organization (Local Bodies & Groups):** The text states that 'Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu.' It also mentions that 'The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes.' Furthermore, 'Rich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government.' The Chola kings also 'gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan... araiyar... and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre.'\n\n2.  **Categories of Land:** The text explicitly lists: 'vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors', 'brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas', 'shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school', 'devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples', and 'pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions.'\n\n3.  **Functioning and Eligibility for Sabha:** The text explains that 'Each brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders.' These assemblies 'worked very efficiently' and their 'decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions.' The sabha 'had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc.' Members for these committees were selected through a lottery-like system where names on palm leaf tickets were put into an earthenware pot, and a young boy drew them out one by one. The Uttaramerur inscription details the eligibility criteria: members 'should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected,' 'have their own homes,' 'be between 35 and 70 years of age,' 'have knowledge of the Vedas,' 'be well-versed in administrative matters and honest.' It also adds disqualifications: 'If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections.' The text also briefly mentions 'Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns.'\n\nAnswer: The Chola administration was structured around 'ur' (settlements of peasants) which grouped into larger units called 'nadu'. Both the village council and the 'nadu' handled administrative functions, including justice and tax collection. Rich peasants of the Vellala caste held significant control over the 'nadu' under the central Chola government, and wealthy landowners were given titles and state offices. Land was categorized into 'vellanvagai' (non-Brahmana peasant proprietors), 'brahmadeya' (gifted to Brahmanas), 'shalabhoga' (for schools), 'devadana/tirunamattukkani' (gifted to temples), and 'pallichchhandam' (donated to Jaina institutions).\n\nThe 'sabha', an assembly of prominent Brahmana landholders, managed each 'brahmadeya' efficiently, recording decisions in inscriptions. These 'sabhas' formed separate committees for irrigation, gardens, and temples, with members selected by drawing palm leaf tickets from a pot. Eligibility for sabha membership, as per the Uttaramerur inscription, required individuals to be land revenue payers, homeowners, aged 35-70, knowledgeable in the Vedas, well-versed in administration, and honest. Disqualifications included prior committee service within three years or failure to submit accounts."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.9", "8.8.1", "7.2.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

When we refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take these identities for granted and assume that they have existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers separating regions have evolved over time (and in fact are still changing). Also, what we understand as regional cultures today are often the product of complex processes of intermixing of local traditions with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As we will see, some traditions appear specific to some regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and yet others derive from older practices in a particular area, but take a new form in other regions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the evolution of the Bengali language and identify the two main categories of early Bengali literature, providing examples for each."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The second text section details the evolution of the Bengali language. It states that early Sanskrit texts suggest the people of Bengal initially 'did not speak Sanskritic languages.' The language's emergence began with 'commercial ties' between Bengal and Magadha from the 'fourth-third centuries BCE,' which led to 'growing influence of Sanskrit.' This influence intensified when 'Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas' in the 'fourth century,' strengthening linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley. By the 'seventh century,' languages related to Sanskrit were observed across Bengal. Even after Akbar conquered Bengal in 1586 and Persian became the administrative language, 'Bengali developed as a regional language,' and by the 'fifteenth century,' Bengali dialects 'came to be united by a common literary language.' Modern Bengali also incorporated 'a wide range of non-Sanskrit words.'\n\nThe text then outlines two categories of early Bengali literature.

The 'second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads.'\n\nAnswer: The Bengali language evolved from non-Sanskritic origins, influenced by commercial ties with Magadha and the settlement of Brahmanas by Gupta rulers, leading to the adoption of Sanskrit-related languages. It developed as a regional language alongside Persian administration, eventually unifying its dialects into a common literary language by the fifteenth century, incorporating diverse non-Sanskrit words.

Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations. They were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Beyond religious devotion, what practical considerations and societal changes influenced the formation of social groups and their roles, as evidenced by Baba Guru Nanak's followers and the emergence of *jatis*?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about practical considerations and societal changes influencing social group formation.

Let us see how they study the Rigveda. \nSome of the hymns in the Rigveda are in the form of dialogues. This is part of one such hymn, a dialogue between a sage named Vishvamitra, and two rivers, (Beas and Sutlej) that were worshipped as goddesses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Inamgaon on Map 2 (page14). It is a site on the river Ghod, a tributary of the Bhima. It was occupied between 3600 and 2700 years ago. Here, adults were generally buried in the ground, laid out straight, with the head towards the north. Sometimes burials were within the houses. Vessels that probably contained food and water were placed with the dead. \nOne man was found buried in a large, four legged clay jar in the courtyard of a five-roomed house (one of the largest houses at the site), in the centre of the settlement. This house also had a granary. The body was placed in a crosslegged position. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe organisation of the Sikhs into a political community during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 8) helped in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda Bahadur\u2019s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. \nUnder a number of able leaders in the eighteenth century, the Sikhs organized themselves into a number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. Their combined forces were known as the grand army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as \u201cresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)\u201d. A system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. \nGuru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega khalsa). Their well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the same inscription as the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur. \nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were divided under different rulers. One of them, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and established his capital at Lahore in 1799. \nTowards the end of the 17th century a powerful state started emerging in the Deccan under the leadership of Shivaji which finally led to the establishment of the Maratha state. Shivaji was born to Shahji and Jija Bai at Shivneri in 1630. Under the guidance of his mother and his guardian Dada Konddev, Shivaji embarked on a career of conquest at a young age. The occupation of Javli made him the undisputed leader of the Mavala highlands which paved the way for further expansion. His exploits against the forces of Bijapur and the Mughals made him a legendary figure. He often resorted to guerrilla warfare against his opponents. By introducing an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi he laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state. \nThe Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasantpastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji\u2019s death, effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji\u2019s successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom. \nBaji Rao I, also known as Baji Rao Ballal was the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath. He was a great Maratha general who is credited to have expanded the Maratha kingdom beyond the Vindhyas and is known for his military campaigns against Malwa, Bundelkhand, Gujarat and the Portugese. \nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very successful military organisation. Their success lay in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed. \nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region. \nChauth : 25 per cent of the land revenue claimed by zamindars. In the Deccan this was collected by the Marathas. Sardeshmukhi : 9-10 per cent of the land revenue paid to the head revenue collector in the Deccan. \nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south (see Map 1). These were not formally included in the Maratha empire, but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, but it came at a price. These military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well. Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under Sindhia\u2019s patronage and Indore under Holkar\u2019s. By all accounts these cities were large and prosperous and functioned as important commercial and cultural centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and Allahabad in the east. \nLike the other states the Jats consolidated their power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra. \nThe power of the Jats reached its zenith under Suraj Mal who consolidated the Jat state at Bharatpur (in present day Rajasthan) during 1756-1763. The areas under the political control of Suraj Mal broadly included parts of modern eastern Rajasthan, southern Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Suraj Mal built a number of forts and palaces and the famous Lohagarh fort in Bharatpur is regarded as one of the strongest forts built in this region. \nThe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, many of the city\u2019s notables took refuge there. His son Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to fight the Mughals. \nWhile the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first associated with royalty under Shah Jahan (see Figure 12 in Chapter 5 and Figure 12 in Chapter 9). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the unique administrative and military contributions of the Sikhs and the Marathas in establishing their regional states, including details about their leadership, organizational structures, and revenue systems."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first identify the sections of the text that discuss the Sikhs and the Marathas. Then, for each group, I will extract information related to their leadership, organizational structures (political and military), and revenue systems, ensuring all details are directly supported by the provided text.\n\nFor the **Sikhs**:\n1.  **Leadership:** The text mentions Guru Gobind Singh fighting battles and instituting the Khalsa. After his death, Banda Bahadur led the Khalsa in revolt. Later, Maharaja Ranjit Singh reunited groups and established his capital.\n2.  **Organizational Structures:** The Sikhs organized into a political community, with the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. In the eighteenth century, they formed bands called 'jathas' and later 'misls', with their combined forces known as the 'grand army' (dal khalsa). They made collective decisions called 'gurmatas' at Amritsar.\n3.  **Revenue System:** They introduced a system called 'rakhi', offering protection to cultivators upon payment of 20 percent of the produce.\n4.  **Military:** Guru Gobind Singh fought Rajput and Mughal rulers. The Khalsa under Banda Bahadur declared sovereign rule by striking coins. They put up successful resistance against Mughal governors and Ahmad Shah Abdali.\n\nFor the **Marathas**:\n1.  **Leadership:** Shivaji established a strong Maratha state, guided by his mother Jija Bai and guardian Dada Konddev. After Shivaji's death, effective power was wielded by Peshwas. Baji Rao I was a great Maratha general. Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia, Gaekwad, and Bhonsle also raised powerful armies.\n2.  **Organizational Structures:** Shivaji carved out a kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs) and peasant-pastoralists (kunbis) who formed the backbone of the army. Under the Peshwas, they developed a very successful military organization.\n3.  **Revenue System:** Shivaji laid foundations with a revenue collection method based on 'chauth' (25 percent of land revenue) and 'sardeshmukhi' (9-10 percent of land revenue).\n4.  **Military:** Shivaji resorted to guerrilla warfare. Their military success involved bypassing Mughal fortified areas, raiding cities, and engaging Mughal armies where their supply lines could be disturbed. They expanded their empire significantly, seizing territories and making others pay tribute.\n\nAnswer: The Sikhs and the Marathas each developed distinct administrative and military strategies to establish their regional states.\n\nFor the **Sikhs**:\n*   **Leadership & Organization:** Guru Gobind Singh played a crucial role, instituting the Khalsa in 1699. After his death, Banda Bahadur led the Khalsa in revolt against Mughal authority, declaring sovereign rule by striking coins. In the eighteenth century, they organized into 'jathas' and 'misls', forming a 'grand army' (dal khalsa) that made collective decisions ('gurmatas') at Amritsar. Maharaja Ranjit Singh later reunited these groups.\n*   **Revenue System:** They introduced the 'rakhi' system, providing protection to cultivators in exchange for 20 percent of their produce.\n*   **Military:** They fought battles against Rajput and Mughal rulers, and successfully resisted Mughal governors and Ahmad Shah Abdali, inspired by the belief that their destiny was to rule.\n\nFor the **Marathas**:\n*   **Leadership & Organization:** Shivaji established a strong state through conquests, guided by his mother Jija Bai and guardian Dada Konddev. He relied on powerful warrior families (deshmukhs) and highly mobile peasant-pastoralists (kunbis) for his army. After Shivaji, the Peshwas wielded effective power and developed a very successful military organization. Baji Rao I, a great general, expanded the kingdom beyond the Vindhyas.\n*   **Revenue System:** They implemented 'chauth' (25 percent of the land revenue) and 'sardeshmukhi' (9-10 percent of the land revenue).\n*   **Military:** Shivaji famously used guerrilla warfare. Their military strategy involved bypassing Mughal fortified areas, raiding cities, and engaging Mughal armies in ways that disrupted their supply lines and reinforcements. This allowed them to expand their empire significantly and levy chauth and sardeshmukhi across the Deccan peninsula and beyond."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.2.1", "6.5.3", "7.10.6", "6.5.9"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n1 How, When and Where\n\nHow Important are Dates?\nThere was a time when historians were fascinated with dates. There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana \u2013 or \u201ccountry inhabited by Gonds\u201d. They practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare the administrative systems and resource management strategies of the Mauryan Empire, the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga, and the Ahom state, based on the provided texts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  First, I will extract details about the Mauryan Empire's administration. The text states that the area around Pataliputra was under direct control with officials collecting taxes from various groups and punishing disobedience, while provinces had governors and followed local customs. Vast areas between centers were controlled for transport and resources (tax/tribute), and forested regions provided specific resources like elephants, timber, honey, and wax. \n2.  Next, I will detail the administrative structure of the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga. The text describes its system as centralized, divided into 'garhs' (controlled by clans), then into 'chaurasis' (84 villages), and further into 'barhots' (12 villages). Its resource management included earning wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants. \n3.  Finally, I will outline the Ahom state's system. The text explains it relied on forced labor called 'paiks', determined by a population census, with villages sending paiks by rotation and populations sometimes being shifted. Paiks contributed to the army, public works, and irrigation. Land was given by village communities, and the king could not take it without community consent. \n4.  By consolidating these points, I can highlight the distinct methods of control, resource collection, and labor mobilization across the three entities.\n\nAnswer: The Mauryan Empire employed a diverse administrative approach: the area around Pataliputra was under direct imperial control with officials collecting taxes and enforcing orders; provinces were ruled from capitals like Taxila or Ujjain, often by royal princes, where local customs were likely followed; vast areas between centers were managed for transport and collecting resources as tax or tribute (e.g., blankets, gold, precious stones); and forested regions, though largely independent, were expected to provide specific resources like elephants, timber, honey, and wax to Mauryan officials.\n\nThe Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga developed a centralized administrative system, dividing its territory into 'garhs', each controlled by a particular Gond clan. These 'garhs' were further subdivided into 'chaurasis' (units of 84 villages), which were then broken down into 'barhots' (made up of 12 villages each). Its resource management strategy included generating wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms.\n\nThe Ahom state's administration was centralized and depended on forced labor, with those compelled to work for the state called 'paiks'. A census determined the population, and each village was required to send a number of paiks by rotation, with people from densely populated areas sometimes shifted to less populated ones. Paiks served in the army during wartime and engaged in public works like building dams and irrigation systems at other times.

This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these long journeys. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFrom the sixteenth century, people began to migrate in large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal to the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern Bengal. As they moved eastwards, they cleared forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new communities of peasants. \nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries received land and often set up mosques that served as centres for religious transformation in these areas. \nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. These were provided by community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People referred to them with affection and respect as pirs. \nPir : A Persian word meaning a spiritual guide. \nThis term included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal. \nAnimism : Attribution of living soul to plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena. \nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapters 2 and 5) that temples and other religious structures were often built by individuals or groups who were becoming powerful \u2013 to both demonstrate their power and proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several \u201clow\u201d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). The coming of the European trading companies created new economic opportunities; many families belonging to these social groups availed of these. As their social and economic position improved, they proclaimed their status through the construction of temples. When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts. (Remember the \u201cBangla dome\u201d in Chapter 5?) This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in temple architecture. \nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. Temples were usually built on a square platform. The interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, such decorations reached a high degree of excellence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here. At some sites, a large number of tools, used for all sorts of activities, were found. These were probably habitation-cum factory sites. In some of the other, smaller sites, there is evidence to suggest that tools were made. Some of the sites were close to springs. Most tools were made from limestone, which was locally available \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIf the context in which information is produced changes with time, what about language and meanings? Historical records exist in a variety of languages which have changed considerably over the years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different from modern Persian. The difference is not just with regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of words also change over time. \nTake the term \u201cHindustan\u201d, for example. Today we understand it as \u201cIndia\u201d, the modern nation-state. When the term was used in the thirteenth century by Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler who wrote in Persian, he meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term in a political sense for lands that were a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan. The areas included in this term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but the term never included south India. By contrast, in the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used the word \u201cHind\u201d. While the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like \u201cIndia\u201d did exist, the term \u201cHindustan\u201d did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with it today. \nHistorians today have to be careful about the terms they use because they meant different things in the past. Take, for example, a simple term like \u201cforeigner\u201d. It is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian. In the medieval period a \u201cforeigner\u201d was any stranger who appeared say in a given village, someone who was not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term pardesi might be used to describe such a person and in Persian, ajnabi.) A city-dweller, therefore, might have regarded a forest-dweller as a \u201cforeigner\u201d, but two peasants living in the same village were not foreigners to each other, even though they may have had different religious or caste backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the defining characteristics of pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar before the mid-nineteenth century, and how did the British Company's reforms after 1854 fundamentally change this educational system, particularly impacting poor peasant families?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text explicitly describes the pre-British pathshalas based on William Adam's report from the 1830s. It states they had 'no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table.' It also notes that 'teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students.' A key feature was its flexibility, where 'classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields,' allowing 'even children of peasant families [to] study.'\n2. The text then details the changes introduced by the Company after 1854. The Company 'decided to improve the system of vernacular education' by 'introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections.' Specific measures included appointing 'government pandits,' requiring gurus to 'submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable.' Teaching was to be 'based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination.' Students were asked to 'pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline.'\n3. The impact on poor peasant families is directly addressed. The text states that 'in the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible.' However, 'the discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields.' Consequently, 'inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn.'\n\nAnswer: Before the mid-nineteenth century, pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar were flexible institutions characterized by no fixed fees, printed books, dedicated school buildings, furniture, blackboards, separate classes, roll-call registers, annual examinations, or regular timetables. Teaching was oral, determined by the guru, and fees varied based on parental income. Crucially, classes were suspended during harvest time, enabling children from peasant families to attend. After 1854, the British Company introduced reforms to impose order, including appointing government pandits, mandating regular timetables, textbook-based teaching, annual examinations, fixed fees, and strict attendance and discipline. This new rigid system significantly disadvantaged poor peasant families, as their children could no longer balance school with essential farm work during harvest, leading to their absences being labeled as indiscipline."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.9.8", "8.7.2", "7.1.2", "6.10.1", "6.2.11"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb).

The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFranchise \u2013 The right to vote. \n \nA Constitution is Written \n\n Between December 1946 and November 1949, some three hundred Indians had a series of meetings on the country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the three main features of the Indian Constitution, and what major debates did the Constituent Assembly face regarding the division of governmental powers and the national language?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly outlines 'One feature' as the adoption of universal adult franchise for all Indians above 21.

These deities included Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as Durga. \nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti, an idea that became very popular at this time. Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti. \nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is included in the Mahabharata (see Chapter 12). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna, his devotee and friend, to abandon all dharmas and take refuge in him, as only he can set Arjuna free from every evil. This form of worship gradually spread to different parts of the country. \nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasised devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices. \nAccording to this system of belief, if a devotee worships the chosen deity with a pure heart, the deity will appear in the form in which he or she may desire. So, the deity could be thought of as a human being, lion, tree or any other form. Once this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities. \nBecause the deities were special, these images of the deity were often placed within special homes, places that we describe as temples. You will learn more about these temples in Chapter 12. Bhakti inspired some of the best expressions in art \u2014 sculpture, poetry and architecture. \nBhakti Comes from the Sanskrit term bhaj meaning \u2018to divide or share.\u2019 This suggests an intimate, two-way relationship between the deity and the devotee. Bhakti is directed towards Bhagavat, which is often translated as god, but also means one who possesses and shares bhaga, literally good fortune or bliss. The devotee, known as the bhakta or the bhagavata, shares his or her chosen deity\u2019s bhaga. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBC, we have seen stands for Before Christ.

Sometimes CE is used instead of AD and BCE instead of BC. The letters CE stand for Common Era and BCE for Before Common Era. We use these terms because the Christian Era is now used in most countries of the world. In India we began using this form of dating from about two hundred years ago. And sometimes, the letters BP meaning Before Present are used. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAround 2500 years ago, the people of Athens set up a form of government, which was called a democracy, which lasted for about 200 years. \nAll free men over the age of 30 were recognised as full citizens. There was an assembly that met at least 40 times a year to decide on important matters. All citizens could attend these meetings. \nAppointments for many positions were made through lottery. All those who wanted to be chosen gave in their names, and then some were selected through lottery. \nCitizens were expected to serve in the army and the navy. However, women were not considered citizens. Also, many foreigners, who lived and worked in Athens as merchants and crafts persons did not have rights as citizens. \nBesides, there were several thousand slaves in Athens, who worked in mines, fields, households and workshops. They too were not treated as citizens. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the core tenets of the Bhakti system, including who could follow it, its emphasis on worship, and its influence on artistic expression, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity.

Designs were engraved on some pieces, while beads were also made out of them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe period after the thirteenth century saw a new wave of the bhakti movement in north India. This was an age when Islam, Brahmanical Hinduism, Sufism, various strands of bhakti, and the Nathpanths, Siddhas and Yogis influenced one another. We saw that new towns (Chapter 6) and kingdoms (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new professions and finding new roles for themselves. Such people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and labourers, thronged to listen to these new saints and spread their ideas. \nSome of them like Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak rejected all orthodox religions. Others like Tulsidas and Surdas accepted existing beliefs and practices but wanted to make these accessible to all. Tulsidas conceived of God in the form of Rama. Tulsidas\u2019s composition, the Ramcharitmanas, written in Awadhi (a language used in eastern Uttar Pradesh), is important both as an expression of his devotion and as a literary work. Surdas was an ardent devotee of Krishna. His compositions, compiled in the Sursagara, Surasaravali and Sahitya Lahari, express his devotion. Also contemporary was Shankaradeva of Assam (late fifteenth century) who emphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems and plays in Assamese. He began the practice of setting up namghars or houses of recitation and prayer, a practice that continues to date. \nThe essence of Shankaradeva\u2019s devotion came to be known as Eka Sarana Nama Dharma (supreme surrender to the One). The teachings of Shankaradeva were based on the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavata Purana. He also encouraged the establishment of satra or monasteries for transmission of knowledge. His major compositions included Kirtana-ghosha. \nThis tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal, Ravidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth century. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint from a caste considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d. She was devoted to Krishna and composed innumerable bhajans expressing her intense devotion. Her songs also openly challenged the norms of the \u201cupper\u201d castes and became popular with the masses in Rajasthan and Gujarat. \nA unique feature of most of the saints is that their works were composed in regional languages and could be sung. They became immensely popular and were handed down orally from generation to generation. Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and women transmitted these songs, often adding their own experiences. Thus the songs as we have them today are as much a creation of the saints as of generations of people who sang them. They have become a part of our living popular culture. \nThis is a song composed by Mirabai: Ranaji, I have left your norms of shame, and false decorum of the princely life. I have left your town. And yet Rana why have you kept up enmity against me? Rana you gave me a cup of poison. I drank it laughing. Rana I will not be destroyed by you. And yet Rana why have you kept up enmity against me? \nAn important contribution of Bhakti saints was towards the development of music. Jayadeva of Bengal composed the Gita Govinda in Sanskrit, each song composed in a particular raga and tala. A significant impact that these saints had on music was the use of bhajan, kirtan and abhang. These songs which emphasised on emotional experience had a tremendous appeal to the common people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nFind Ajanta on Map 7 (page 113).

They became immensely popular and were handed down orally from generation to generation. Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and women transmitted these songs, often adding their own experiences.' Next, I will identify their impact on society and culture. The text indicates that some saints 'rejected all orthodox religions' (Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak), while others 'accepted existing beliefs and practices but wanted to make these accessible to all' (Tulsidas and Surdas). Mirabai's songs 'openly challenged the norms of the \u201cupper\u201d castes and became popular with the masses.'

Their impact on society and culture included challenging orthodox religions, making existing beliefs more accessible to all, and openly questioning 'upper' caste norms. They significantly contributed to the development of music through forms like bhajan, kirtan, and abhang, which emphasized emotional experience and appealed widely to common people.

Sometimes, even when thousands of men ruled together, each one was known as a raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through discussion and debate. For example, if they were attacked by an enemy, they met to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. However, women, dasas and kammakaras could not participate in these assemblies. \nBoth the Buddha and Mahavira (about whom you will read in Chapter 7) belonged to ganas or sanghas. Some of the most vivid descriptions of life in the sanghas can be found in Buddhist books. \nRajas of powerful kingdoms tried to conquer the sanghas. Nevertheless, these lasted for a very long time, till about 1500 years ago, when the last of the ganas or sanghas were conquered by the Gupta rulers, about whom you will read in Chapter 11. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nSanskrit is part of a family of languages known as Indo-European. Some Indian languages such as Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri and Sindhi; Asian languages such as Persian and many European languages such as English, French, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish belong to this family. They are called a family because they originally had words in common. \nTake the words matr (Sanskrit), ma (Hindi) and mother (English). \nOther languages used in the subcontinent belong to different families. For instance, those used in the north-east belong to the Tibeto-Burman family; Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam belong to the Dravidian family; and the languages spoken in Jharkhand and parts of central India belong to the Austro-Asiatic family. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nBefore large kingdoms emerged, different groups of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses. As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the defining characteristics of a *gana* or *sangha* form of government, including who was excluded from their assemblies, and how did the teachings of the Buddha and Jainas offer an alternative to the prevailing ideas of social inequality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question asks for the characteristics of a *gana* or *sangha* government and who was excluded from their assemblies.

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.

While new tools and the system of transplantation (Chapter 6) increased production, irrigation was also used. Irrigation works that were built during this time included canals, wells, tanks, and artificial lakes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAround the time when Jainism and Buddhism were becoming popular, brahmins developed the system of ashramas. Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars. \nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble\u2019s position in court and the larger his salary. \nNobles with a zat of 5,000 were ranked higher than those of 1,000. In Akbar\u2019s reign there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars had increased to 79. \nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary. \nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country. \nIn Akbar\u2019s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb\u2019s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the various ways tribal groups interacted with or were affected by significant societal and political changes, including their resistance and integration."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section, 'A Closer Look / Birsa Munda,' details how tribal groups reacted to external pressures through rebellion. For instance, the Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals in 1855, and the Bastar Rebellion in 1910. Birsa Munda's movement, a prominent example, aimed to reform tribal society and drive out 'dikus' (outsiders) like missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the British government, demonstrating active resistance. The movement's significance included forcing the colonial government to introduce laws protecting tribal land and showcasing the tribal capacity to protest injustice. \n\nThe fifth text section, discussing 'Jatis and social change,' shows other forms of interaction and integration. It explains that many tribes and social groups were 'taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis.' While leading tribal families could join the ruling class, such as some becoming Rajput clans, a large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. Conversely, dominant tribes in Punjab, Sind, and the North-West Frontier adopted Islam quite early and 'continued to reject the caste system,' indicating a different path of interaction with broader societal structures.\n\nAnswer: Tribal groups exhibited diverse interactions with significant societal and political changes. Some, like the Kols, Santhals, and the Mundas under Birsa, actively resisted through rebellions against new laws, taxes, exploitation by moneylenders, and the influence of missionaries and landlords, even aiming to establish their own 'Raj.' Others were gradually integrated into the caste-based society, with leading families sometimes joining the ruling class (e.g., becoming Rajput clans) and the majority joining lower jatis. Additionally, some dominant tribes adopted Islam and subsequently rejected the orthodox Hindu caste system."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.4", "6.9.2", "7.4.6", "6.7.9", "7.7.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe craftspersons of Bidar were so famed for their inlay work in copper and silver that it came to be called Bidri. The Panchalas or Vishwakarma community, consisting of goldsmiths, bronzesmiths, blacksmiths, masons and carpenters, were essential to the building of temples. They also played an important role in the construction of palaces, big buildings, tanks and reservoirs. Similarly, weavers such as the Saliyar or Kaikkolars emerged as prosperous communities, making donations to temples. Some aspects of cloth making like cotton cleaning, spinning and dyeing became specialised and independent crafts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nTraditional food habits are generally based on locally available items of food. Bengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist monasteries) depict scenes of fish being dressed and taken to the market in baskets. \nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat nonvegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for the Bengal Brahmanas. The Brihaddharma Purana, a thirteenth-century Sanskrit text from Bengal, permitted the local Brahmanas to eat certain varieties of fish. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\n5 When People Rebel \n 1857 and After \n\n Policies and the People \n\n Nawabs lose their power Since the mid-eighteenth century, nawabs and rajas had seen their power erode. They had gradually lost their authority and honour. Residents had been stationed in many courts, the freedom of the rulers reduced, their armed forces disbanded, and their revenues and territories taken away by stages. \nMany ruling families tried to negotiate with the Company to protect their interests. For example, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi wanted the Company to recognise her adopted son as the heir to the kingdom after the death of her husband. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II, pleaded that he be given his father\u2019s pension when the latter died. However, the Company, confident of its superiority and military powers, turned down these pleas. \nAwadh was one of the last territories to be annexed. In 1801, a subsidiary alliance was imposed on Awadh, and in 1856 it was taken over. Governor -General Dalhousie declared that the territory was being misgoverned and British rule was needed to ensure proper administration. \nThe Company even began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the Company. In 1849, Gover nor -General Dalhousie announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king would be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another place in Delhi to reside in. In 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal king and after his death none of his descendants would be recognised as kings \u2013 they would just be called princes. \nThe peasants and the sepoys \n In the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection. Many failed to pay back their loans to the moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations. \nThe Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company also had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service. Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs. Did you know that in those days many people in the country believed that if they crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste? So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to Burma by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to go by the land route. They were severely punished, and since the issue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the Company\u2019s army had to agree to serve overseas if required. \nSepoys also reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of them were peasants and had families living in the villages. So the anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys. \nResponses to reforms \n The British believed that Indian society had to be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage of widows. English-language education was actively promoted. After 1830, the Company allowed Christian missionaries to function freely in its domain and even own land and property. In 1850, a new law was passed to make conversion to Christianity easier. This law allowed an Indian who had converted to Christianity to inherit the property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to feel that the British were destroying their religion, their social customs and their traditional way of life. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAlthough inscriptions, coins and architecture provide a lot of information, especially valuable are \u201chistories\u201d, tarikh (singular)/tawarikh (plural), written in Persian, the language of administration under the Delhi Sultans. The authors of tawarikh were learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. \nThe circle of justice - Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century: A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king promotes justice and honest governance. \nKeep the following additional details in mind: (1) the authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. (3) These authors advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared by everybody. \nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmish\u2019s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. She was removed from the throne in 1240. \nBirthright - Privileges claimed on account of birth. For example, people believed that nobles inherited their rights to govern, because they were born in certain families. Gender distinctions - Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women. \nWhat Minhaj-i Siraj thought about Raziyya? Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore asked: \u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi (1262- 1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in Kashmir (980- 1003). Her title is interesting: it comes from \u201cdidi\u201d or \u201celder sister\u201d, an obviously affectionate term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary purposes behind the construction of temples, mosques, tanks, and reservoirs, and which communities or individuals were significantly involved in their creation or associated with their use, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for the purposes of constructing temples, mosques, tanks, and reservoirs, and the individuals/communities involved.

It also mentions that kings constructed large temples to appear 'like a god' and to present the temple as 'a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies.'

Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the aspects of flexibility found in the lifestyles of hunter-gatherers and in the pre-British pathshalas, explaining the reasons behind these flexible approaches in each context."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first identify the description of flexibility related to hunter-gatherers from the second text section and outline the reasons for their mobile lifestyle. Then, I will extract information about the flexible system of education in pre-British pathshalas from the third text section, detailing its characteristics and the reasons for its suitability. Finally, I will synthesize these findings to describe the flexible approaches and their underlying reasons in both contexts.\n\nFrom the second text section, hunter-gatherers exhibited flexibility by moving from place to place. The text states at least four reasons for this movement: (1) to find new plant and animal resources after depleting them in one area, (2) to follow the movements of animals they hunted, (3) to search for different kinds of plants and fruits that bore in different seasons, and (4) to find water during dry seasons, especially when living near seasonal rivers or lakes. They also traveled to meet friends and relatives, doing so on foot.\n\nFrom the third text section, the pre-British pathshalas had a flexible system of education. Key aspects of this flexibility included: no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. Fees were based on parental income, teaching was oral, and the guru adapted the curriculum to students' needs. All students sat together, with the guru interacting separately with groups of different learning levels. The primary reason for this flexibility, as stated in the text, was that it was 'suited to local needs,' particularly allowing children from rural peasant families to work in the fields during harvest time, with classes resuming once crops were cut and stored. This ensured that even children of peasant families could study.\n\nAnswer: Hunter-gatherers demonstrated flexibility through their nomadic lifestyle, moving from place to place for several reasons: to find new food resources after exhausting local supplies, to follow migrating animals, to access seasonal plant produce, and to seek water during dry periods. They also traveled to meet friends and relatives. In the context of pre-British pathshalas, flexibility was evident in their educational system, which lacked fixed fees, printed books, dedicated buildings, furniture, separate classes, roll-calls, annual exams, or rigid timetables. Fees varied with parental income, teaching was oral and adapted by the guru to student needs, and classes were often held in various informal locations. This flexible system was primarily suited to local needs, allowing children from peasant families to work in the fields during harvest time and resume their studies afterward, thereby accommodating their agricultural responsibilities."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.12.4", "6.2.1", "8.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nVery often, old buildings have a story to tell. Nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, when railway lines were being laid down for the first time in the Punjab, engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in present-day Pakistan. To them, it seemed like a mound that was a rich source of ready made, high quality bricks. So they carried off thousands of bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the city to build railway lines. Many buildings were completely destroyed. \nThen, about eighty years ago, archaeologists found the site, and realised that this was one of the oldest cities in the subcontinent. As this was the first city to be discovered, all other sites from where similar buildings (and other things) were found were described as Harappan. These cities developed about 4700 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How does the timeline of the Harappan city's discovery and its initial treatment compare to the general understanding of when hunter-gatherers first lived in the subcontinent, and what were the main difficulties hunter-gatherers encountered in obtaining food?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Harappan City Timeline and Treatment:** The first text section states that Harappa was discovered by railway engineers nearly 150 years ago. These engineers used bricks from the city to build railway lines, destroying many buildings. It was about eighty years ago that archaeologists found the site and realized it was one of the oldest cities in the subcontinent, developed about 4700 years ago.\n2.  **Hunter-Gatherer Presence:** The second text section indicates that people described as hunter-gatherers lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago.\n3.  **Hunter-Gatherer Food Difficulties:** The second section explains that obtaining food was challenging for hunter-gatherers. They needed to be alert, quick, and have presence of mind to hunt animals, many of which were faster or stronger. For gathering, they had to identify which plants or parts of plants were edible, as many could be poisonous, and know the seasons when fruits ripened.\n\nAnswer: The Harappan city was initially discovered by railway engineers nearly 150 years ago and its buildings were largely destroyed for bricks, with archaeologists later identifying it as an ancient city (about 4700 years old) approximately 80 years ago. This contrasts with hunter-gatherers, who are known to have lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Hunter-gatherers faced significant difficulties in obtaining food; they needed to be alert, quick, and have presence of mind to hunt animals that were often faster or stronger, and they had to accurately identify edible plants and their seasonal availability due to the risk of poisonous varieties."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.1", "6.2.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThrough the Eyes of the People \n\n To get a glimpse of what people were thinking those days about British rule, study Sources 1 and 2. \n The list of eighty-four rules \n Given here are excerpts from the book Majha Pravaas, written by Vishnubhatt Godse, a Brahman from a village in Maharashtra. He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments. Among them were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis. They advocated renunciation of the world. To them the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realisation of oneness with it. To achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation. These groups became particularly popular among \u201clow\u201d castes. Their criticism of conventional religion created the ground for devotional religion to become a popular force in northern India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars. \nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble\u2019s position in court and the larger his salary. \nNobles with a zat of 5,000 were ranked higher than those of 1,000. In Akbar\u2019s reign there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars had increased to 79. \nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary. \nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country. \nIn Akbar\u2019s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb\u2019s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nQazi \u2013 A judge \n Mufti \u2013 A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer \n Impeachment \u2013 A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons \n Dharmashastras \u2013 Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 BCE onwards \n Sawar \u2013 Men on horses \n Musket \u2013 A heavy gun used by infantry soldiers \n Matchlock \u2013 An early type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match \nSetting up a New Administration \n\n Warren Hastings (Governor-General from 1773 to 1785) was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts \u2013 a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat ). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors. \nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta. \nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. His office \u2013 the Collectorate \u2013 became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. \nThe Company army \n Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. \nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry requirements of the Company\u2019s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of the Company\u2019s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century the British began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the primary reasons for the growing distrust and excitement among the sepoys of the British East India Company army?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text provides several reasons for the growing distrust and excitement among the sepoys. \n\nFirstly, from the section 'Through the Eyes of the People', Vishnubhatt Godse's account describes sepoys believing that the English intended to 'wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims' by introducing 'eighty-four rules'. Subedar Sitaram Pande's memoirs identify the 'seizing of Oudh' as a key event that 'filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust'. He also mentions that agents from the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi actively 'worked upon the feelings of sepoys' by recounting British treachery. Crucially, Pande highlights the widespread 'excitement in every regiment' caused by the report that the 'cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs', which was seen as an attempt to insult their religion and convert them to Christianity.\n\nSecondly, the section 'Setting up a New Administration' under 'The Company army' explains that the British aim to develop a 'uniform military culture' involved subjecting soldiers to 'European-style training, drill and discipline'. This 'created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers', making it difficult for individuals to 'give up their caste and religious feelings'. This policy directly contributed to the religious and social anxieties of the sepoys, aligning with the fears of religious interference mentioned in the accounts of the mutiny.\n\nAnswer: The primary reasons for the growing distrust and excitement among the sepoys included the belief that the British intended to destroy their religions through measures like 'eighty-four rules' and the introduction of greased cartridges (made with cow and pig fat), the political resentment stemming from the 'seizing of Oudh', and the British policy within the Company army that 'ignored caste and community feelings' in its uniform military culture.

Rana Pratap ascended the throne at Mewar in 1572, with Udaipur and large part of Mewar under his control. A series of envoys were sent to the Rana to persuade him to accept Mughal suzerainty, but he stood his ground. \nMany Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional politics at the Mughal court. \nThese influential Rajput families claimed the subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa. Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial territories neighbouring their watans. Nagaur was conquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, while Amber seized large portions of Bundi. Sawai Raja Jai Singh founded his new capital at Jaipur and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe pressure on these principalities and checked their further expansion. \nMany Rajput chieftains built a number of forts on hill tops which became centres of power. With extensive fortifications, these majestic structures housed urban centres, palaces, temples, trading centres, water harvesting structures and other buildings. The Chittorgarh fort contained many water bodies varying from talabs (ponds) to kundis (wells), baolis (stepwells), etc. \nA description of Raja Jai Singh in a Persian account of 1732: Raja Jai Singh was at the height of his power. He was the governor of Agra for 12 years and of Malwa for 5 or 6 years. He possessed a large army, artillery and great wealth. His sway extended from Delhi to the banks of the Narmada. \nSawai Jai Singh, the ruler of Amber constructed five astronomical observatories, one each in Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, Mathura and Varanasi.

These included the Banjaras (see also Chapter 7). Several traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors who bought horses. \nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards \u2013 the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. \nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China. \nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive. This eventually drew European traders to India. We will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns. \nWith its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in present-day Afghanistan) became politically and commercially important from the sixteenth century onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was primarily carried on through this route. In the seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum in those days. Camels carried dried fruits, dates, carpets, silks and even fresh fruits from Kabul to the subcontinent and elsewhere. Slaves were also brought here for sale. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThis was also the time when other scholars were at work. One of the most famous was Panini, who prepared a grammar for Sanskrit.

Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nConclusion \n\n Thus the East India Company was transformed from a trading company to a territorial colonial power. The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a far-off country like India. \nBy 1857 the Company came to exercise direct rule over about 83 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country, the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After \n\n In March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere are several things we can find out \u2014 what people ate, the kinds of clothes they wore, the houses in which they lived.

It states that in 1859, the indigo ryots felt they had the support of local zamindars and village headmen. The text details that headmen mobilized peasants and fought planters' lathiyals, and zamindars urged ryots to resist due to their own unhappiness with the planters' increasing power and forced land leases. Additionally, the ryots 'imagined that the British government would support them.' This belief was reinforced by the Lieutenant Governor's tour in 1859, which ryots interpreted as government sympathy, and by magistrate Ashley Eden's notice stating ryots would not be compelled to accept contracts, which was misconstrued as Queen Victoria's declaration against indigo cultivation.\n\nAnswer: The indigo ryots were empowered to rebel in 1859 due to the perceived support from local zamindars and village headmen, who mobilized peasants and urged resistance.

Tipu\u2019s legendary swords are now part of valuable collections in museums in England. But do you know why the sword was so special? The sword had an incredibly hard and sharp edge that could easily rip through the opponent\u2019s armour. This quality of the sword came from a special type of high carbon steel called Wootz which was produced all over south India. Wootz steel when made into swords produced a very sharp edge with a flowing water pattern. This pattern came from very small carbon crystals embedded in the iron. \nFrancis Buchanan who toured through Mysore in 1800, a year after Tipu Sultan\u2019s death, has left us an account of the technique by which Wootz steel was produced in many hundreds of smelting furnaces in Mysore. In these furnaces, iron was mixed with charcoal and put inside small clay pots. Through an intricate control of temperatures the smelters produced steel ingots that were used for sword making not just in India but in West and Central Asia too. Wootz is an anglicised version of the Kannada word ukku, Telugu hukku and Tamil and Malayalam urukku \u2013 meaning steel. \nIndian Wootz steel fascinated European scientists. Michael Faraday, the legendary scientist and discoverer of electricity and electromagnetism, spent four years studying the properties of Indian Wootz (1818-22). However, the Wootz steel making process, which was so widely known in south India, was completely lost by the mid-nineteenth century. Can you guess why this was so? The swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India. \nAbandoned furnaces in villages \n Production of Wootz steel required a highly specialised technique of refining iron. But iron smelting in India was extremely common till the end of the nineteenth century. In Bihar and Central India, in particular, every district had smelters that used local deposits of ore to produce iron which was widely used for the manufacture of implements and tools of daily use. The furnaces were most often built of clay and sun-dried bricks. The smelting was done by men while women worked the bellows, pumping air that kept the charcoal burning. \nBy the late nineteenth century, however, the craft of iron smelting was in decline. In most villages, furnaces fell into disuse and the amount of iron produced came down. Why was this so? One reason was the new forest laws that you have read about (Chapter 4). When the colonial government prevented people from entering the reserved forests, how could the iron smelters find wood for charcoal? Where could they get iron ore? Defying forest laws, they often entered the forests secretly and collected wood, but they could not sustain their occupation on this basis for long. Many gave up their craft and looked for other means of livelihood. \nIn some areas the government did grant access to the forest. But the iron smelters had to pay a very high tax to the forest department for every furnace they used. This reduced their income. Moreover, by the late nineteenth century iron and steel was being imported from Britain. Ironsmiths in India began using the imported iron to manufacture utensils and implements. This inevitably lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters. By the early twentieth century, the artisans producing iron and steel faced a new competition. \nIron and steel factories come up in India \n The year was 1904. In the hot month of April, Charles Weld, an American geologist and Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of Jamsetji Tata, were travelling in Chhattisgarh in search of iron ore deposits. They had spent many months on a costly venture looking for sources of good iron ore to set up a modern iron and steel plant in India. Jamsetji Tata had decided to spend a large part of his fortune to build a big iron and steel industry in India. But this could not be done without identifying the source of fine quality iron ore. \nOne day, after travelling for many hours in the forests, Weld and Dorabji came upon a small village and found a group of men and women carrying basketloads of iron ore. These people were the Agarias. When asked where they had found the iron ore, the Agarias pointed to a hill in the distance. Weld and Dorabji reached the hill after an exhausting trek through dense forests. On exploring the hill the geologist declared that they had at last found what they had been looking for. Rajhara Hills had one of the finest ores in the world. \nBut there was a problem. The region was dry and water \u2013 necessary for running the factory \u2013 was not to be found nearby. The Tatas had to continue their search for a more suitable place to set up their factory. However, the Agarias helped in the discovery of a source of iron ore that would later supply the Bhilai Steel Plant. A few years later a large area of forest was cleared on the banks of the river Subarnarekha to set up the factory and an industrial township \u2013 Jamshedpur. Here there was water near iron ore deposits. The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) that came up began producing steel in 1912. \nTISCO was set up at an opportune time. All through the late nineteenth century, India was importing steel that was manufactured in Britain. Expansion of the railways in India had provided a huge market for rails that Britain produced. For a long while, British experts in the Indian Railways were unwilling to believe that good quality steel could be produced in India. \nBy the time TISCO was set up the situation was changing. In 1914 the First World War broke out. Steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe. So imports of British steel into India declined dramatically and the Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails. As the war dragged on for several years, TISCO had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war. By 1919 the colonial government was buying 90 per cent of the steel manufactured by TISCO. Over time TISCO became the biggest steel industry within the British empire. \nIn the case of iron and steel, as in the case of cotton textiles, industrial expansion occurred only when British imports into India declined and the market for Indian industrial goods increased. This happened during the First World War and after. As the nationalist movement developed and the industrial class became stronger, the demand for government protection became louder. Struggling to retain its control over India, the British government had to concede many of these demands in the last decades of colonial rule. \nBellows \u2013 A device or equipment that can pump air. \n Slag heaps \u2013 The waste left when smelting metal. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe kings and kingdoms you have been reading about could not have existed without the support of flourishing villages. While new tools and the system of transplantation (Chapter 6) increased production, irrigation was also used. Irrigation works that were built during this time included canals, wells, tanks, and artificial lakes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors led to the decline of traditional Indian Wootz steel and iron smelting, and what circumstances contributed to the establishment and initial success of the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The decline of traditional Indian Wootz steel and iron smelting is explained in the first two sections. The text states that the Wootz steel making process was lost by the mid-nineteenth century because 'the swords and armour making industry died with the conquest of India by the British and imports of iron and steel from England displaced the iron and steel produced by craftspeople in India.' For general iron smelting, the text identifies several reasons for its decline by the late nineteenth century: 'new forest laws' which prevented smelters from finding wood for charcoal and iron ore, high taxes imposed by the forest department on furnaces, and the import of 'iron and steel from Britain' which lowered the demand for locally produced iron. \n\nThe establishment and initial success of TISCO are detailed in the third section. TISCO was established after Charles Weld and Dorabji Tata located fine quality iron ore (with help from the Agarias) and a suitable site with water near ore deposits in Jamshedpur, beginning production in 1912. Its initial success was significantly boosted by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The war caused 'imports of British steel into India declined dramatically' as British steel had to meet war demands in Europe. This led the 'Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails,' and TISCO also produced 'shells and carriage wheels for the war,' with the colonial government buying '90 per cent of the steel manufactured by TISCO' by 1919. The text concludes that 'industrial expansion occurred only when British imports into India declined and the market for Indian industrial goods increased,' which happened during and after the First World War.\n\nAnswer: Traditional Indian Wootz steel production declined by the mid-nineteenth century primarily due to the British conquest of India, which led to the demise of the swords and armour making industry and the displacement of Indian steel by imports from England. General iron smelting also declined due to new forest laws restricting access to wood for charcoal and iron ore, high taxes on furnaces, and the reduced demand caused by imported British iron and steel.\n\nTISCO was established after Charles Weld and Dorabji Tata successfully located high-quality iron ore and a suitable site near water (Jamshedpur), beginning steel production in 1912. Its initial success was largely driven by the First World War, which caused British steel imports to India to decline. This led the Indian Railways to turn to TISCO for rails, and TISCO also supplied war materials like shells and carriage wheels, with the colonial government becoming a major buyer of its steel."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.6.3", "6.3.6", "6.9.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nSiddhartha, also known as Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, was born about 2500 years ago. This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What initiatives did Emperor Akbar undertake to foster understanding and tolerance among diverse religious and cultural groups within his empire, and how were these efforts documented or supported by his administration?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text indicates that Emperor Akbar was interested in the religion and social customs of different people.

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nQazi \u2013 A judge \n Mufti \u2013 A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer \n Impeachment \u2013 A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons \n Dharmashastras \u2013 Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 BCE onwards \n Sawar \u2013 Men on horses \n Musket \u2013 A heavy gun used by infantry soldiers \n Matchlock \u2013 An early type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match \nSetting up a New Administration \n\n Warren Hastings (Governor-General from 1773 to 1785) was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts \u2013 a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat ). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors. \nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta. \nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. His office \u2013 the Collectorate \u2013 became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. \nThe Company army \n Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. \nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry requirements of the Company\u2019s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of the Company\u2019s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century the British began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the immediate and longer-term challenges India faced upon gaining independence in August 1947?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that \"When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges.\" It categorizes these challenges into immediate and longer-term.

Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe rich, glossy colours of silk, as well as its smooth texture, make it a highly valued fabric in most societies. Making silk is a complicated process. Raw silk has to be extracted from the cocoons of silk worms, spun into thread and then woven into cloth. Techniques of making silk were first invented in China around 7000 years ago. While the methods remained a closely guarded secret for thousands of years, some people from China who went to distant lands on foot, horseback, and on camels, carried silk with them. The paths they followed came to be known as the Silk Route. \nSometimes, Chinese rulers sent gifts of silk to rulers in Iran and west Asia, and from there, the knowledge of silk spread further west. About 2000 years ago, wearing silk became the fashion amongst rulers and rich people in Rome. It was very expensive, as it had to be brought all the way from China, along dangerous roads, through mountains and deserts. People living along the route often demanded payments for allowing traders to pass through. \nLook at Map 6 (pages 84-85) which shows the Silk Route and its branches. Some kings tried to control large portions of the route. This was because they could benefit from taxes, tributes and gifts that were brought by traders travelling along the route. In return, they often protected the traders who passed through their kingdoms from attacks by robbers. \nThe best-known of the rulers who controlled the Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over central Asia and north-west India around 2000 years ago. Their two major centres of power were Peshawar and Mathura. Taxila was also included in their kingdom. During their rule, a branch of the Silk Route extended from Central Asia down to the seaports at the mouth of the river Indus, from where silk was shipped westwards to the Roman Empire. The Kushanas were amongst the earliest rulers of the subcontinent to issue gold coins. These were used by traders along the Silk Route. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nArchaeologists think that objects found with a skeleton probably belonged to the dead person.

These were carefully arranged by people, and were used to mark burial sites. The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. \nSome important megalithic sites are shown on Map 2 (page14). While some megaliths can be seen on the surface, other megalithic burials are often underground. \nSometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground.

Also found are tools and weapons of iron and sometimes, skeletons of horses, horse equipment and ornaments of stone and gold. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTake a look at Maps 1 and 2. Map 1 was made in 1154 CE by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi. The section reproduced here is a detail of the Indian subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The two maps are quite different even though they are of the same area. In al-Idrisi\u2019s map, south India is where we would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the island at the top. Place-names are marked in Arabic, and there are some well-known names like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (spelt in the map as Qanauj). Map 2 was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during which time information about the subcontinent had changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly detailed. This map was used by European sailors and merchants on their voyages (see Chapter 6). \nEqually important is the fact that the science of cartography differed in the two periods. When historians read documents, maps and texts from the past they have to be sensitive to the different historical backgrounds \u2013 the contexts \u2013 in which information about the past was produced. \nCartographer - A person who makes maps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe craftspersons of Bidar were so famed for their inlay work in copper and silver that it came to be called Bidri. The Panchalas or Vishwakarma community, consisting of goldsmiths, bronzesmiths, blacksmiths, masons and carpenters, were essential to the building of temples. They also played an important role in the construction of palaces, big buildings, tanks and reservoirs. Similarly, weavers such as the Saliyar or Kaikkolars emerged as prosperous communities, making donations to temples. Some aspects of cloth making like cotton cleaning, spinning and dyeing became specialised and independent crafts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThanjavur is also an example of a temple town. Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop. Temples were often central to the economy and society. Rulers built temples to demonstrate their devotion to various deities. They also endowed temples with grants of land and money to carry out elaborate rituals, feed pilgrims and priests and celebrate festivals. Pilgrims who flocked to the temples also made donations. \nBronze is an alloy containing copper and tin. Bell metal contains a greater proportion of tin than other kinds of bronze. This produces a bell-like sound. Chola bronze statues (see Chapter 2) were made using the \u201clost wax\u201d technique. First, an image was made of wax. This was covered with clay and allowed to dry. Next it was heated, and a tiny hole was made in the clay cover. The molten wax was drained out through this hole. Then molten metal was poured into the clay mould through the hole. Once the metal cooled and solidified, the clay cover was carefully removed, and the image was cleaned and polished. \nTemple authorities used their wealth to finance trade and banking. Gradually a large number of priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc. settled near the temple to cater to its needs and those of the pilgrims. Thus grew temple towns. Towns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. \nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships. Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns. Ajmer (Rajasthan) was the capital of the Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later became the suba headquarters under the Mughals. It provides an excellent example of religious coexistence. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, the celebrated Sufi saint (see also Chapter 8) who settled there in the twelfth century, attracted devotees from all creeds. Near Ajmer is a lake, Pushkar, which has attracted pilgrims from ancient times. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did temples contribute to the growth of towns, and which specific craft communities were essential to this development, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that temples were central to the economy and society, directly fostering the growth of towns.

People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Animals were sacrificed. Slaves and servants were ill treated. Besides, there were quarrels in families and amongst neighbours. Ashoka felt it was his duty to solve these problems. So, he appointed officials, known as the dhamma mahamatta who went from place to place teaching people about dhamma.

International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities.

Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him.

Christ\u2019s teachings were that He was the Saviour of the world. He also taught people to treat others with love and trust others, just as they themselves wanted to be treated. \nChrist\u2019s teachings appealed to ordinary people, and spread through West Asia, Africa and Europe. The first Christian preachers came from West Asia to the west coast of the subcontinent within a hundred years of Christ\u2019s death. \nThe Christians of Kerala, known as Syrian Christians because they probably came from West Asia, are amongst the oldest Christian communities in the world. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n\u201cGeneral\u201dconstituencies - Election districts with no reservations for any religious or other community \nQuit India and Later \n\n Mahatma Gandhi decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British in the middle of the Second World War. The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what shared spiritual and ethical principles can be identified between the teachings of Jesus Christ and the practices of Sufism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

These are called oracle bones, because they were used to predict the future. Kings got scribes to write questions on the bones \u2014 would they win battles? Would the harvest be good? Would they have sons? The bones were then put into the fire, and they cracked because of the heat. Then fortunetellers studied these cracks, and tried to predict the future. As you may expect, they sometimes made mistakes. \nThese kings lived in palaces in cities. They amassed vast quantities of wealth, including large, elaborately decorated bronze vessels. However, they did not know the use of iron. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare and contrast the administrative measures implemented by Sultan Alauddin Khalji and Sultan Muhammad Tughluq in response to the Mongol threat and the need to maintain a large standing army."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text describes how both Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq faced Mongol attacks and had to mobilize large standing armies, posing a huge administrative challenge.\n2.

To feed them, 'produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna' was used, with tax 'fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield.' He 'chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas.' To prevent price rises due to cash salaries, 'Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi.' His measures were 'quite successful' and he 'successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions.'\n3. For Muhammad Tughluq, after defeating the Mongol army, he 'raised a large standing army' with a plan to attack Transoxiana. Instead of a new town, 'the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there,' with residents sent to 'Daulatabad in the south.'

The text notes that Muhammad Tughluq's measures were 'conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols,' unlike Alauddin's defensive ones.\n4. In summary, both Sultans maintained large armies and paid cash salaries. However, Alauddin built a new garrison town, collected a fixed tax, and controlled market prices, leading to success. Muhammad Tughluq emptied an old city displacing residents, levied additional taxes during a famine, and used an untrustworthy token currency, leading to widespread failure and rebellion. Notably, Muhammad Tughluq's approach was more offensive in intent.\n\nAnswer: Sultan Alauddin Khalji constructed a new garrison town (Siri) for his soldiers, fed them with a fixed 50% tax from the Ganga-Yamuna lands, paid cash salaries, and successfully controlled market prices in Delhi to prevent inflation. His measures were effective in withstanding Mongol invasions. In contrast, Sultan Muhammad Tughluq emptied an old city (Dehli-i Kuhna) and displaced its residents to garrison his soldiers, levied additional taxes (which coincided with a famine) to feed his army, and paid cash salaries using a 'token' currency made of cheap metals. This token currency was not trusted and easily counterfeited, leading to the failure of his administrative measures, widespread rebellion, and the recall of the currency.

They arranged for them to stay together in the sangha, an association of those who left their homes. \nThe rules made for the Buddhist sangha were written down in a book called the Vinaya Pitaka. From this we know that there were separate branches for men and women. All men could join the sangha. However, children had to take the permission of their parents and slaves that of their masters. Those who worked for the king had to take his permission and debtors that of creditors. Women had to take their husbands\u2019 permission. \nMen and women who joined the sangha led simple lives. They meditated for most of the time, and went to cities and villages to beg for food during fixed hours. That is why they were known as bhikkhus (the Prakrit word for renouncer \u2014 beggar) and bhikkhunis. They taught others, and helped one another. They also held meetings to settle any quarrels that took place within the sangha. \nThose who joined the sangha included brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants, labourers, barbers, courtesans and slaves. Many of them wrote down the teachings of the Buddha. Some of them also composed beautiful poems, describing their life in the sangha. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMercantile \u2013 A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices \nEast India Company Comes East \n\n In 1800, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLinguistic \u2013 Relating to language. \nHow were States to be Formed? \n\n Back in the 1920s, the Indian National Congress \u2013 the main party of the freedom struggle \u2013 had promised that once the country won independence, each major linguistic group would have its own province. However, after independence the Congress did not take any steps to honour this promise. For India had been divided on the basis of religion: despite the wishes and efforts of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom had come not to one nation but to two. As a result of the partition of India, more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims. Could the country afford further divisions on the basis of language? \nBoth Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel were against the creation of linguistic states. After the Partition, Nehru said, \u201cdisruptionist tendencies had come to the fore\u201d; to check them, the nation had to be strong and united. Or, as Patel put it: ... the first and last need of India at the present moment is that it should be made a nation \u2026 Everything which helps the growth of nationalism has to go forward and everything which throws obstacles in its way has to be rejected \u2026 We have applied this test to linguistic provinces also, and by this test, in our opinion [they] cannot be supported. \nThat the Congress leaders would now go back on their promise created great disappointment. The Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, the Marathi speakers, had all looked forward to having their own state. The strongest protests, however, came from the Telugu-speaking districts of what was the Madras Presidency. When Nehru went to campaign there during the general elections of 1952, he was met with black flags and slogans demanding \u201cWe want Andhra\u201d. In October of that year, a veteran Gandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger strike demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast went on, it attracted much support. Hartals and bandhs were observed in many towns. \nOn 15 December 1952, fifty-eight days into his fast, Potti Sriramulu died. As a newspaper put it, \u201cthe news of the passing away of Sriramulu engulfed entire Andhra in chaos\u201d. The protests were so widespread and intense that the central government was forced to give in to the demand. Thus, on 1 October 1953, the new state of Andhra came into being, which subsequently became Andhra Pradesh. \nAfter the creation of Andhra, other linguistic communities also demanded their own separate states. A States Reorganisation Commission was set up, which submitted its report in 1956, recommending the redrawing of district and provincial boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu speakers respectively. The large Hindi-speaking region of north India was also to be broken up into several states. A little later, in 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided into separate states for Marathi and Gujarati speakers. In 1966, the state of Punjab was also divided into Punjab and Haryana, the former for the Punjabi speakers (who were also mostly Sikhs), the latter for the rest (who spoke not Punjabi but versions of Haryanvi or Hindi). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's initial trade objectives evolve into political and administrative control in Bengal, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details the East India Company's progression from a trading entity to a political power. Initially, the Company's sole objective was trade, as stated by its charter from Queen Elizabeth I in 1800, which granted it the right to buy goods cheaply in the East and sell them at higher prices in Europe. Competition from other European powers led to conflicts, forcing the Company to fortify its trading posts and engage in armed trade to secure markets, making it 'difficult to separate trade from politics.' The Company established its first factory in Bengal in 1851, acquired zamindari rights over villages like Kalikata (Calcutta) by bribing Mughal officials, and secured a farman from Emperor Aurangzeb for duty-free trade. This led to escalating conflicts with the Nawabs of Bengal, who accused the Company of 'depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab' by refusing to pay taxes and building fortifications. The pivotal moment was the Battle of Plassey in 1757, where Robert Clive's forces defeated Nawab Sirajuddaulah, largely due to Mir Jafar's betrayal, making it 'the first major victory the Company won in India.' After Plassey, the Company installed 'puppet nawabs' like Mir Jafar and Mir Qasim to secure trade concessions and revenue. When these nawabs proved uncooperative, the Company deposed them, eventually realizing that 'We must indeed become nawabs ourselves.' This ambition culminated in 1785 when the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of Bengal, granting it 'the vast revenue resources of Bengal.' This enabled the Company to finance its expenses, troops, and fortifications using Indian revenues, marking its transition from a pure trading company to an administrative and political power.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company began with the sole objective of profitable trade, buying goods cheaply in the East and selling them dear in Europe. Intense competition and conflicts necessitated armed trade and fortification, making it difficult to separate trade from politics. The Company gained a foothold in Bengal through a factory, bribing officials for zamindari rights, and securing duty-free trade. This led to escalating conflicts with the Nawabs of Bengal, culminating in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, which was the Company's first major victory. Subsequently, the Company installed and deposed 'puppet nawabs' to secure concessions and revenue. Eventually, in 1785, the Company was appointed the Diwan of Bengal by the Mughal emperor, granting it control over the province's vast revenue resources, thereby transitioning from a trading enterprise to a significant political and administrative power."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.10.3", "8.2.2", "6.7.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people become different from wild plants and animals. This is because people select plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select those plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select plants that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of bearing the weight of the ripe grain. Seeds from selected plants are preserved and sown to ensure that new plants (and seeds) will have the same qualities. \nAmongst animals, those that are relatively gentle are selected for breeding. As a result, gradually, domesticated animals and plants become different from wild animals and plants. For example, the teeth and horns of wild animals are usually much larger than those of domesticated animals. \nDomestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts of the world. It began about 12,000 years ago. Virtually all the plant and animal produce that we use as food today is a result of domestication. Some of the earliest plants to be domesticated were wheat and barley. The earliest domesticated animals include sheep and goat. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana \u2013 or \u201ccountry inhabited by Gonds\u201d. They practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe rich, glossy colours of silk, as well as its smooth texture, make it a highly valued fabric in most societies. Making silk is a complicated process. Raw silk has to be extracted from the cocoons of silk worms, spun into thread and then woven into cloth. Techniques of making silk were first invented in China around 7000 years ago. While the methods remained a closely guarded secret for thousands of years, some people from China who went to distant lands on foot, horseback, and on camels, carried silk with them. The paths they followed came to be known as the Silk Route. \nSometimes, Chinese rulers sent gifts of silk to rulers in Iran and west Asia, and from there, the knowledge of silk spread further west. About 2000 years ago, wearing silk became the fashion amongst rulers and rich people in Rome. It was very expensive, as it had to be brought all the way from China, along dangerous roads, through mountains and deserts. People living along the route often demanded payments for allowing traders to pass through. \nLook at Map 6 (pages 84-85) which shows the Silk Route and its branches. Some kings tried to control large portions of the route. This was because they could benefit from taxes, tributes and gifts that were brought by traders travelling along the route. In return, they often protected the traders who passed through their kingdoms from attacks by robbers. \nThe best-known of the rulers who controlled the Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over central Asia and north-west India around 2000 years ago. Their two major centres of power were Peshawar and Mathura. Taxila was also included in their kingdom. During their rule, a branch of the Silk Route extended from Central Asia down to the seaports at the mouth of the river Indus, from where silk was shipped westwards to the Roman Empire. The Kushanas were amongst the earliest rulers of the subcontinent to issue gold coins. These were used by traders along the Silk Route. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Compare the administrative divisions and the role of Brahmanas in the societal transformations of the Gond and Ahom kingdoms, based on the provided text."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes the Gond administrative system as becoming centralized, divided into 'garhs' controlled by clans, which were further subdivided into 'chaurasi' (units of 84 villages) and 'barhots' (units of 12 villages). Regarding Gond society, it states that their 'basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes' and 'Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential.' For the Ahoms, the text mentions their administration became 'quite centralised' and 'Ahom society was divided into clans or khels.' It also notes that the 'Ahom state depended upon forced labour' by 'paiks,' with villages sending paiks by rotation. Similar to the Gonds, 'the influence of Brahmanas increased' in Ahom society, with 'Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king,' and Hinduism eventually became the 'predominant religion.'\n\nAnswer: The Gond kingdom's administration was centralized, with divisions into 'garhs,' 'chaurasi' (84 villages), and 'barhots' (12 villages). Their society transformed from equal to unequal classes, with Brahmanas gaining significant influence through land grants from Gond rajas. The Ahom state also developed a centralized administration, with society divided into 'khels' (clans), and relied on 'paiks' (forced labor) supplied by villages. Both kingdoms experienced an increase in the influence of Brahmanas, who were granted land by the respective kings, leading to Brahmanas becoming more influential and Hinduism becoming a predominant religion in the Ahom kingdom."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.6", "6.3.3", "6.10.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLinguistic \u2013 Relating to language. \nHow were States to be Formed? \n\n Back in the 1920s, the Indian National Congress \u2013 the main party of the freedom struggle \u2013 had promised that once the country won independence, each major linguistic group would have its own province. However, after independence the Congress did not take any steps to honour this promise. For India had been divided on the basis of religion: despite the wishes and efforts of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom had come not to one nation but to two. As a result of the partition of India, more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims. Could the country afford further divisions on the basis of language? \nBoth Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel were against the creation of linguistic states. After the Partition, Nehru said, \u201cdisruptionist tendencies had come to the fore\u201d; to check them, the nation had to be strong and united. Or, as Patel put it: ... the first and last need of India at the present moment is that it should be made a nation \u2026 Everything which helps the growth of nationalism has to go forward and everything which throws obstacles in its way has to be rejected \u2026 We have applied this test to linguistic provinces also, and by this test, in our opinion [they] cannot be supported. \nThat the Congress leaders would now go back on their promise created great disappointment. The Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, the Marathi speakers, had all looked forward to having their own state. The strongest protests, however, came from the Telugu-speaking districts of what was the Madras Presidency. When Nehru went to campaign there during the general elections of 1952, he was met with black flags and slogans demanding \u201cWe want Andhra\u201d. In October of that year, a veteran Gandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger strike demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast went on, it attracted much support. Hartals and bandhs were observed in many towns. \nOn 15 December 1952, fifty-eight days into his fast, Potti Sriramulu died. As a newspaper put it, \u201cthe news of the passing away of Sriramulu engulfed entire Andhra in chaos\u201d. The protests were so widespread and intense that the central government was forced to give in to the demand. Thus, on 1 October 1953, the new state of Andhra came into being, which subsequently became Andhra Pradesh. \nAfter the creation of Andhra, other linguistic communities also demanded their own separate states. A States Reorganisation Commission was set up, which submitted its report in 1956, recommending the redrawing of district and provincial boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu speakers respectively. The large Hindi-speaking region of north India was also to be broken up into several states. A little later, in 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided into separate states for Marathi and Gujarati speakers. In 1966, the state of Punjab was also divided into Punjab and Haryana, the former for the Punjabi speakers (who were also mostly Sikhs), the latter for the rest (who spoke not Punjabi but versions of Haryanvi or Hindi). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period. At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe organisation of the Sikhs into a political community during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 8) helped in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda Bahadur\u2019s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. \nUnder a number of able leaders in the eighteenth century, the Sikhs organized themselves into a number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. Their combined forces were known as the grand army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as \u201cresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)\u201d. A system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. \nGuru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega khalsa). Their well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the same inscription as the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur. \nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were divided under different rulers. One of them, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and established his capital at Lahore in 1799. \nTowards the end of the 17th century a powerful state started emerging in the Deccan under the leadership of Shivaji which finally led to the establishment of the Maratha state. Shivaji was born to Shahji and Jija Bai at Shivneri in 1630. Under the guidance of his mother and his guardian Dada Konddev, Shivaji embarked on a career of conquest at a young age. The occupation of Javli made him the undisputed leader of the Mavala highlands which paved the way for further expansion. His exploits against the forces of Bijapur and the Mughals made him a legendary figure. He often resorted to guerrilla warfare against his opponents. By introducing an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi he laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state. \nThe Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasantpastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji\u2019s death, effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji\u2019s successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom. \nBaji Rao I, also known as Baji Rao Ballal was the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath. He was a great Maratha general who is credited to have expanded the Maratha kingdom beyond the Vindhyas and is known for his military campaigns against Malwa, Bundelkhand, Gujarat and the Portugese. \nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very successful military organisation. Their success lay in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed. \nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region. \nChauth : 25 per cent of the land revenue claimed by zamindars. In the Deccan this was collected by the Marathas. Sardeshmukhi : 9-10 per cent of the land revenue paid to the head revenue collector in the Deccan. \nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south (see Map 1). These were not formally included in the Maratha empire, but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, but it came at a price. These military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well. Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under Sindhia\u2019s patronage and Indore under Holkar\u2019s. By all accounts these cities were large and prosperous and functioned as important commercial and cultural centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and Allahabad in the east. \nLike the other states the Jats consolidated their power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra. \nThe power of the Jats reached its zenith under Suraj Mal who consolidated the Jat state at Bharatpur (in present day Rajasthan) during 1756-1763. The areas under the political control of Suraj Mal broadly included parts of modern eastern Rajasthan, southern Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Suraj Mal built a number of forts and palaces and the famous Lohagarh fort in Bharatpur is regarded as one of the strongest forts built in this region. \nThe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, many of the city\u2019s notables took refuge there. His son Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to fight the Mughals. \nWhile the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first associated with royalty under Shah Jahan (see Figure 12 in Chapter 5 and Figure 12 in Chapter 9). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the understanding and impact of social divisions, particularly caste and linguistic identity, evolve from early Buddhist teachings through medieval societal structures to the challenges faced during India's national movement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The Buddhist text introduces an ideal of unity where traditional social divisions such as 'varna and ranks and family' are 'forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks,' likening it to rivers losing their names in the ocean. This suggests a spiritual transcendence of social hierarchy. In contrast, during the medieval period (700-1750), the text describes a system where 'people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations.' It notes that 'Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati,' indicating a structured, yet dynamic, system of social differentiation. Moving to the national movement, an ideal of national unity emerged where 'India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender.' However, the challenge of linguistic identity presented a significant division. Despite the Indian National Congress's pre-independence promise of linguistic provinces, leaders like Nehru and Patel initially opposed them post-independence, fearing 'further divisions on the basis of language' after the partition based on religion. Nevertheless, intense protests, such as the one leading to the creation of Andhra state after Potti Sriramulu's death, eventually forced the government to establish the States Reorganisation Commission and redraw boundaries along linguistic lines, demonstrating a complex evolution from transcending divisions to formalizing certain identities within a national framework.\n\nAnswer: From early Buddhist teachings emphasizing the forgetting of 'varna and ranks and family' upon joining the monastic order, social divisions evolved into the medieval formation of 'jatis or sub-castes' based on occupation and background, where ranks were variable. During the national movement, the ideal was 'all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender.' However, linguistic identity presented a challenge, with initial governmental resistance to linguistic states post-independence due to fears of further division, ultimately leading to their formation following widespread protests like the one for Andhra state."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.7.8", "8.10.3", "7.1.4", "7.10.6", "8.9.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

You must first provide your reasoning (Chain of Thought) and then the final answer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Given the following documents, answer the question. \nProvide a Chain of Thought reasoning before your final answer.\n\n<DOCUMENT id='0'>\nCaste and Social Reform \n\n Some of the social reformers we have been discussing also criticised caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy translated an old Buddhist text that was critical of caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of Bhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes. In Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in 1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these reformers and members of reform associations were people of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these reformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch, in an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in their lives. \nThere were also others who questioned the injustices of the caste social order. During the course of the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries began setting up schools for tribal groups and \u201clower\u201d-caste children. These children were thus equipped with some resources to make their way into a changing world. \nAt the same time, the poor began leaving their villages to look for jobs that were opening up in the cities. There was work in the factories that were coming up, and jobs in municipalities. You have read about the expansion of cities in Chapter 6. Think of the new demands of labour this created. Drains had to be dug, roads laid, buildings constructed, and cities cleaned. This required coolies, diggers, carriers, bricklayers, sewage cleaners, sweepers, palanquin bearers, rickshaw pullers. Where did this labour come from? The poor from the villages and small towns, many of them from low castes, began moving to the cities where there was a new demand for labour. Some also went to work in plantations in Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad and Indonesia. Work in the new locations was often very hard. But the poor, the people from low castes, saw this as an opportunity to get away from the oppressive hold that upper-caste landowners exercised over their lives and the daily humiliation they suffered. \nThere were other jobs too. The army, for instance, offered opportunities. A number of Mahar people, who were regarded as untouchable, found jobs in the Mahar Regiment. The father of B.R. Ambedkar, the leader of the Dalit movement, taught at an army school. \nDemands for equality and justice \n Gradually, by the second half of the nineteenth century, people from within the Non-Brahman castes began organising movements against caste discrimination, and demanded social equality and justice. \nThe Satnami movement in Central India was founded by Ghasidas who worked among the leatherworkers and organised a movement to improve their social status. In eastern Bengal, Haridas Thakur\u2019s Matua sect worked among Chandala cultivators. Haridas questioned Brahmanical texts that supported the caste system. In what is present-day Kerala, a guru from Ezhava caste, Shri Narayana Guru, proclaimed the ideals of unity for his people. He argued against treating people unequally on the basis of caste differences. According to him, all humankind belonged to the same caste. One of his famous statements was: \u201coru jati, oru matam, oru daivam manushyanu\u201d (one caste, one religion, one god for humankind). \nAll these sects were founded by leaders who came from Non-Brahman castes and worked amongst them. They tried to change those habits and practices which provoked the contempt of dominant castes. They tried to create a sense of self-esteem among the subordinate castes. \nGulamgiri \n One of the most vocal amongst the \u201clow-caste\u201d leaders was Jyotirao Phule. Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up by Christian missionaries. On growing up he developed his own ideas about the injustices of caste society. He set out to attack the Brahmans\u2019 claim that they were superior to others, since they were Aryans. Phule argued that the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside the subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true children of the country \u2013 those who had lived here from before the coming of the Aryans. As the Aryans established their dominance, they began looking at the defeated population as inferior, as low-caste people. According to Phule, the \u201cupper\u201d castes had no right to their land and power: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people, the so-called low castes. \nPhule claimed that before Aryan rule there existed a golden age when warrior-peasants tilled the land and ruled the Maratha countryside in just and fair ways. He proposed that Shudras (labouring castes) and Ati Shudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste discrimination. The Satyashodhak Samaj, an association Phule founded, propagated caste equality. \nIn 1873, Phule wrote a book named Gulamgiri, meaning slavery. Some ten years before this, the American Civil War had been fought, leading to the end of slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves, thus establishing a link between the conditions of the \u201clower\u201d castes in India and the black slaves in America. \nAs this example shows, Phule extended his criticism of the caste system to argue against all forms of inequality. He was concerned about the plight of \u201cupper\u201d-caste women, the miseries of the labourer, and the humiliation of the \u201clow\u201d castes. This movement for caste reform was continued in the twentieth century by other great dalit leaders like Dr B.R. Ambedkar in western India and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in the south. \nWho could enter temples? \n Ambedkar was born into a Mahar family. As a child he experienced what caste prejudice meant in everyday life. In school he was forced to sit outside the classroom on the ground, and was not allowed to drink water from taps that upper -caste children used. After finishing school, he got a fellowship to go to the US for higher studies. On his return to India in 1919, he wrote extensively about \u201cupper\u201d- caste power in contemporary society. \nIn 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry movement, in which his Mahar caste followers participated. Brahman priests were outraged when the Dalits used water from the temple tank. Ambedkar led three such movements for temple entry between 1927 and 1935. His aim was to make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society. \nThe Non-Brahman movement \n In the early twentieth century, the non-Brahman movement started. The initiative came from those non-Brahman castes that had acquired access to education, wealth and influence. They argued that Brahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the north who had conquered southern lands from the original inhabitants of the region \u2013 the indigenous Dravidian races. They also challenged Brahmanical claims to power. \nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he was called, came from a middle-class family. Interestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early life and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully. Later, he became a member of the Congress, only to leave it in disgust when he found that at a feast organised by nationalists, seating arrangements followed caste distinctions \u2013 that is, the lower castes were made to sit at a distance from the upper castes. Convinced that untouchables had to fight for their dignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement. He argued that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt that all religious authorities saw social divisions and inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to free themselves, therefore, from all religions in order to achieve social equality. \nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures, especially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver, and the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said that these texts had been used to establish the authority of Brahmans over lower castes and the domination of men over women. \nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The forceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-caste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self-criticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. But orthodox Hindu society also reacted by founding Sanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal in the north, and associations like the Brahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these associations was to uphold caste distinctions as a cornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was sanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over caste continued beyond the colonial period and are still going on in our own times. \nOrganising for reform \n The Brahmo Samaj \n The Brahmo Samaj, formed in 1830, prohibited all forms of idolatry and sacrifice, believed in the Upanishads, and forbade its members from criticising other religious practices. It critically drew upon the ideals of religions \u2013 especially of Hinduism and Christianity \u2013 looking at their negative and positive dimensions. \nDerozio and Young Bengal \n Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the 1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all authority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked tradition and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned for the freedom of thought and expression. \nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda \n Named after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s guru, the Ramakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service and selfless action. \nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra Nath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his well founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world. After hearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the New York Herald reported, \u201cWe feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation\u201d. Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in modern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the Vedanta philosophy on a global scale. But his mission was not simply to talk of religion. He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery of his country men. He firmly believed that any reform could become successful only by uplifting the condition of the masses. Therefore, his clarion call to the people of India was to rise above the narrow confines of their \u2018religion of the kitchen\u2019 and come together in the service of the nation. By sending out this call he made a signal contribution to the nascent nationalism of India. His sense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception. He was convinced that many of the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the nations of the world come together on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth was to unite on the basis of a common spiritual heritage. In this exhortation he became truly \u2018the symbol of a new spirit and a source of strength for the future\u2019. \nThe Prarthana Samaj \n Established in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, abolish child marriage, encourage the education of women, and end the ban on widow remarriage. Its religious meetings drew upon Hindu, Buddhist and Christian texts. \nThe Veda Samaj \n Established in Madras (Chennai) in 1864, the Veda Samaj was inspired by the Brahmo Samaj. It worked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women\u2019s education. Its members believed in one God. They condemned the superstitions and rituals of orthodox Hinduism. \nThe Aligarh Movement \n The Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, founded by Sayyid Ahmed Khan in 1875 at Aligarh, later became the Aligarh Muslim University. The institution offered modern education, including Western science, to Muslims. The Aligarh Movement, as it was known, had an enormous impact in the area of educational reform. \nThe Singh Sabha Movement \n Reform organisations of the Sikhs, the first Singh Sabhas were formed at Amritsar in 1873 and at Lahore in 1879. The Sabhas sought to rid Sikhism of superstitions, caste distinctions and practices seen by them as non-Sikh. They promoted education among the Sikhs, often combining modern instruction with Sikh teachings. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLike earlier rulers, some of these kings maintained a well-organised army, with elephants, chariots, cavalry and foot soldiers. Besides, there were military leaders who provided the king with troops whenever he needed them. They were not paid regular salaries. Instead, some of them received grants of land. They collected revenue from the land and used this to maintain soldiers and horses, and provide equipment for warfare. These men were known as samantas. Whenever the ruler was weak, samantas tried to become independent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere are several ways of describing people \u2014 in terms of the work they do, the language they speak, the place they belong to, their family, their communities and cultural practices. Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. \nThere are two groups who are described in terms of their work \u2014 the priests, sometimes called brahmins, who performed various rituals, and the rajas. \nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be learning about later. They did not have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Generally, sons did not automatically succeed fathers as rajas. \nTwo words were used to describe the people or the community as a whole. One was the word jana, which we still use in Hindi and other languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 6. \nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name. So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and so on. \nSometimes, the people who composed the hymns described themselves as Aryas and called their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were women and men who were often captured in war. They were treated as the property of their owners, who could make them do whatever work they wanted. \nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of these. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here. At some sites, a large number of tools, used for all sorts of activities, were found. These were probably habitation-cum factory sites. In some of the other, smaller sites, there is evidence to suggest that tools were made. Some of the sites were close to springs. Most tools were made from limestone, which was locally available \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the various strategies and key figures involved in challenging caste inequalities and promoting social reform in India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text 'Caste and Social Reform' comprehensively outlines various efforts to combat caste inequalities. Initially, reformers like Rammohun Roy (who translated a Buddhist text critical of caste), the Prarthana Samaj (which believed in spiritual equality), and the Paramhans Mandali (founded to abolish caste) initiated reform. Christian missionaries also contributed by setting up schools for tribal and 'lower'-caste children. Economic mobility offered another avenue, as poor and low-caste individuals moved to cities for jobs in factories, municipalities, and the army (e.g., the Mahar Regiment), or to plantations, seeking escape from upper-caste oppression.\n\nSpecific movements emerged from within non-Brahman castes: Ghasidas founded the Satnami movement for leatherworkers, Haridas Thakur's Matua sect worked among Chandala cultivators, and Shri Narayana Guru from the Ezhava caste advocated for unity with the message 'one caste, one religion, one god for humankind.'\n\nJyotirao Phule was a prominent figure who challenged Brahmanical claims of superiority by arguing Aryans were foreigners, founded the Satyashodhak Samaj to propagate caste equality, and wrote 'Gulamgiri' to link Indian 'low-caste' conditions with American slavery. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, experiencing caste prejudice as a Mahar, led multiple temple entry movements to expose societal prejudices. The Non-Brahman movement and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar) further challenged Brahmanical power, with Periyar founding the Self Respect Movement and criticizing Hindu scriptures that supported social divisions. Additionally, broader reform organizations like the Brahmo Samaj, Prarthana Samaj, and Veda Samaj actively sought to remove caste restrictions and promote equality.\n\nAnswer: Various strategies were employed to challenge caste inequalities and promote social reform. These included early criticisms by reformers like Rammohun Roy, the Prarthana Samaj, and the Paramhans Mandali. Christian missionaries provided education for 'lower'-caste children.

Jyotirao Phule challenged Brahmanical claims, founded the Satyashodhak Samaj, and wrote 'Gulamgiri.' Dr. B.R. Ambedkar led temple entry movements, while the Non-Brahman movement and E.V.

These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe search for an independent foreign policy \n India gained freedom soon after the devastations of the Second World War. At that time a new international body \u2013 the United Nations \u2013 formed in 1945 was in its infancy.The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of the Cold War, that is, power rivalries and ideological conflicts between the USA and the USSR, with both countries creating military alliances. This was also the period when colonial empires were collapsing and many countries were attaining independence. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was also the foreign minister of newly independent India, developed free India\u2019s foreign policy in this context. Non-alignment formed the bedrock of this foreign policy. \nLed by statesmen from Egypt, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Ghana and India, the non-aligned movement urged countries not to join either of the two major alliances. But this policy of staying away from alliances was not a matter of remaining \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d. The former means remaining aloof from world affairs whereas non-aligned countries such as India played an active role in mediating between the American and Soviet alliances. They tried to prevent war \u2014 often taking a humanitarian and moral stand against war. However, for one reason or another, many non-aligned countries including India got involved in wars. By the 1970s, a large number of countries had joined the non-aligned movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nZoroaster was an Iranian prophet. His teachings are contained in a book called the Avesta. The language of the Avesta, and the practices described in it are very similar to those of the Vedas. The basic teachings of Zoroaster are contained in the maxim \u201cGood thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.\u201d Here is a verse from the Zend Avesta: \u201cLord, grant strength and the rule of truth and good thinking, by means of which one shall create peace and tranquillity.\u201d \nFor more than a thousand years, Zoroastrianism was a major religion in Iran. Later, some Zoroastrians migrated from Iran and settled down in the coastal towns of Gujarat and Maharashtra. They were the ancestors of today\u2019s Parsis. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nContemporary historians and travellers give very scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did tribal societies in the subcontinent interact with the evolving caste system and larger political structures, and what were the different outcomes of these interactions as described in the text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text describes several ways tribal societies interacted with the caste system and political structures. \n\nFirstly, some tribes were directly subdued by powerful empires. For instance, the Langahs and Arghuns in Multan and Sind were 'subdued by the Mughals,' and the Chero chiefdoms in Bihar and Jharkhand were attacked and later 'subjugated' by Mughal forces under Aurangzeb (Section 1 and Section 3).\n\nSecondly, many tribes were integrated into the caste-based society. The text states that 'many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis' (Section 5). This process was often 'with the support of the Brahmanas.' However, this integration was not uniform; 'only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class,' while 'a large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society' (Section 5).\n\nThirdly, some tribes resisted or rejected the caste system. Dominant tribes in Punjab, Sind, and the North-West Frontier, having adopted Islam early, 'continued to reject the caste system,' finding the 'unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism,' not widely accepted in their areas (Section 5). This aligns with the earlier mention that 'many people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins' and that in some areas, the 'influence of the priests was limited' (Section 3).\n\nFinally, the text notes the rise of powerful tribal clans, like some Rajput clans, which had been tribes earlier and came to replace older rulers, setting an example for other tribal people (Section 5). The Bhils, a large tribe, also saw some members become 'settled agriculturists and some even zamindars' by the late sixteenth century, while others remained hunter-gatherers (Section 1). The text explicitly states that 'the emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people' (Section 5).\n\nAnswer: Tribal societies in the subcontinent experienced varied interactions with the evolving caste system and political structures. Some tribes, such as the Langahs, Arghuns, and Cheros, were subdued and subjugated by powerful empires like the Mughals. Many other tribes were integrated into the caste-based society, often with the support of Brahmanas, receiving the status of jatis; however, only leading tribal families could join the ruling class, while the majority became part of lower jatis. Conversely, dominant tribes in regions like Punjab, Sind, and the North-West Frontier, having adopted Islam, rejected the caste system and its unequal social order. Furthermore, some tribal clans, like certain Rajputs, rose to power, replacing older rulers and demonstrating how tribal groups could evolve into ruling classes, illustrating the close relationship between the emergence of states and social change among tribal people."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.7.3", "8.10.5", "6.6.2", "6.7.10", "7.7.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSanskrit is part of a family of languages known as Indo-European. Some Indian languages such as Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri and Sindhi; Asian languages such as Persian and many European languages such as English, French, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish belong to this family. They are called a family because they originally had words in common. \nTake the words matr (Sanskrit), ma (Hindi) and mother (English). \nOther languages used in the subcontinent belong to different families. For instance, those used in the north-east belong to the Tibeto-Burman family; Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam belong to the Dravidian family; and the languages spoken in Jharkhand and parts of central India belong to the Austro-Asiatic family. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nKalinga is the ancient name of coastal Orissa (see Map 5, page 76).

The second text section, under 'How Important are Dates?', explains that 'There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies.' It further clarifies that historians 'wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne.'

Let us look at some of these. \nKalidasa is known for his plays depicting life in the king\u2019s court. An interesting feature about these plays is that the king and most brahmins are shown as speaking Sanskrit, while women and men other than the king and brahmins use Prakrit. His most famous play, Abhijnana Shakuntalam, is the story of the love between a king named Dushyanta and a young woman named Shakuntala. We find an interesting description of the plight of a poor fisherman in this play. \nThe Chinese pilgrim Fa Xian noticed the plight of those who were treated as untouchables by the high and mighty. They were expected to live on the outskirts of the city. He writes: \u201cIf such a man enters a town or a market place, he strikes a piece of wood, in order to keep himself separate; people, hearing this sound, know what it means and avoid touching him or brushing against him.\u201d \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what evidence exists for how language use reflected social hierarchy or regional differences in ancient and medieval times?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Social Hierarchy via Plays:** The text explicitly states that in Kalidasa's plays, \"the king and most brahmins are shown as speaking Sanskrit, while women and men other than the king and brahmins use Prakrit.\" This directly demonstrates how language use distinguished different social statuses. \n2. **Regional Linguistic Evolution:** The evolution of the Bengali language illustrates regional differences. Early Sanskrit texts indicate that \"the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages.\" However, due to \"commercial ties\" with Magadha and the \"Gupta rulers establish[ing] political control over north Bengal and began[ning] to settle Brahmanas,\" Sanskrit's influence grew, leading to the development of Bengali as a regional language derived from Sanskrit, but also incorporating non-Sanskrit words. This shows a shift in regional linguistic patterns influenced by external cultural and political factors. \n3. **Regional Literary Preferences:** Further evidence of regional differences linked to cultural influence is seen in early Bengali literature. The text notes that the category of literature \"independent of Sanskrit,\" such as Nath literature and folk tales, was \"particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak.\" This suggests varying linguistic and literary preferences across regions, potentially correlated with the strength of Brahmana influence.\n\nAnswer: Language use reflected social hierarchy as seen in Kalidasa's plays, where kings and most Brahmins spoke Sanskrit, while women and other men used Prakrit. Regional differences were evident in the evolution of Bengali, which initially was not Sanskritic but later became influenced by Sanskrit through commercial ties and the settlement of Brahmanas.

As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nDomestication is the name given to the process in which people grow plants and look after animals. Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people become different from wild plants and animals. This is because people select plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select those plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select plants that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of bearing the weight of the ripe grain. Seeds from selected plants are preserved and sown to ensure that new plants (and seeds) will have the same qualities. \nAmongst animals, those that are relatively gentle are selected for breeding. As a result, gradually, domesticated animals and plants become different from wild animals and plants. For example, the teeth and horns of wild animals are usually much larger than those of domesticated animals. \nDomestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts of the world. It began about 12,000 years ago. Virtually all the plant and animal produce that we use as food today is a result of domestication. Some of the earliest plants to be domesticated were wheat and barley. The earliest domesticated animals include sheep and goat. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBC, we have seen stands for Before Christ. You will sometimes find AD before dates. This stands for two Latin words, Anno Domini, meaning in the year of the Lord (i.e. Christ). So 2012 can also be written as AD 2012. Sometimes CE is used instead of AD and BCE instead of BC. The letters CE stand for Common Era and BCE for Before Common Era. We use these terms because the Christian Era is now used in most countries of the world. In India we began using this form of dating from about two hundred years ago.

Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times.

The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s.

Nowadays most girls from middle-class families go to school, and often study with boys. On growing up, many of them go to colleges and universities, and take up jobs after that. They have to be adults before they are legally married, and according to law, they can marry anyone they like, from any caste and community, and widows can remarry too. All women, like all men, can vote and stand for elections. Of course, these rights are not actually enjoyed by all. Poor people have little or no access to education, and in many families, women cannot choose their husbands. \nTwo hundred years ago things were very different. Most children were married off at an early age. Both Hindu and Muslim men could marry more than one wife. In some parts of the country, widows were praised if they chose death by burning themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands. Women who died in this manner, whether willingly or otherwise, were called \u201csati\u201d, meaning virtuous women. Women\u2019s rights to property were also restricted. Besides, most women had virtually no access to education. In many parts of the country people believed that if a woman was educated, she would become a widow. \nDifferences between men and women were not the only ones in society. In most regions, people were divided along lines of caste. Brahmans and Kshatriyas considered themselves as \u201cupper castes\u201d. Others, such as traders and moneylenders (often referred to as Vaishyas) were placed after them. Then came peasants, and artisans such as weavers and potters (referred to as Shudras). At the lowest rung were those who laboured to keep cities and villages clean or worked at jobs that upper castes considered \u201cpolluting\u201d, that is, it could lead to the loss of caste status. The upper castes also treated many of these groups at the bottom as \u201cuntouchable\u201d. They were not allowed to enter temples, draw water from the wells used by the upper castes, or bathe in ponds where upper castes bathed. They were seen as inferior human beings. Over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many of these norms and perceptions slowly changed. Let us see how this happened. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nOne of the commonest ways of describing people is in terms of the language they speak. When we refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take these identities for granted and assume that they have existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers separating regions have evolved over time (and in fact are still changing). Also, what we understand as regional cultures today are often the product of complex processes of intermixing of local traditions with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As we will see, some traditions appear specific to some regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and yet others derive from older practices in a particular area, but take a new form in other regions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts, crafts and production activities flourished in towns and villages. Over the centuries important political, social and economic developments had taken place. But social change was not the same everywhere, because different kinds of societies evolved differently. It is important to understand how, and why, this happened. \nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms. The difference between the high and low, and between the rich and poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key characteristics of women's status and the social caste divisions in the Indian subcontinent approximately two hundred years ago, and how did the varna system contribute to these hierarchies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The first text section, '8 Women, Caste and Reform', details the status of women 'Two hundred years ago'. It states that most children were married off at an early age, both Hindu and Muslim men could marry more than one wife, widows were praised for choosing death by burning (Sati) and called 'sati', women's property rights were restricted, and most women had virtually no access to education due to the belief that it would make them widows.\n2. The same section also describes the social caste divisions 'Two hundred years ago'. It notes that people were divided along caste lines, with Brahmans and Kshatriyas as 'upper castes', followed by Vaishyas (traders and moneylenders), then Shudras (peasants and artisans). At the lowest rung were groups considered 'untouchable', who performed 'polluting' jobs, were denied entry to temples, access to upper-caste wells, or bathing in their ponds, and were seen as inferior human beings.\n3. The second text section, discussing 'social change', explains the underlying contribution of the varna system. It states that 'In large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna' and that 'These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms.' It further mentions that 'Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further.' This indicates the varna system was the foundational framework that influenced and intensified the social and caste hierarchies observed approximately two hundred years ago.\n\nAnswer: Approximately two hundred years ago, women faced early marriage, polygamy for men, the practice of Sati for widows, restricted property rights, and virtually no access to education due to the belief that it would lead to widowhood. Socially, people were divided along caste lines, with Brahmans and Kshatriyas as 'upper castes,' followed by Vaishyas, then Shudras, and at the lowest rung, 'untouchables' who performed 'polluting' jobs and faced severe restrictions like denial of temple entry and access to common wells. The varna system contributed to these hierarchies as society was already divided according to its rules, which were prescribed by Brahmanas, accepted by rulers, and further intensified under the Delhi Sultans and Mughals."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.8.1", "7.7.1", "7.9.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, how did the 'factory sites' associated with early human tool-making differ from the 'factories' established by the East India Company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first step is to locate the description of 'factory sites' in the text.

It explains that this 'factory' was 'the base from which the Company\u2019s traders...operated' and 'had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat'.\nComparing these descriptions, the primary difference lies in their purpose and activities. The stone tool 'factory sites' were places for the production of stone tools from raw materials. In contrast, the East India Company's 'factory' was a trading post and administrative center, primarily used for storing goods for export, housing Company officials, and serving as a base for trade operations, not for manufacturing raw materials into finished goods like tools.\n\nAnswer: The 'factory sites' associated with early human tool-making were locations where stone was found and tools were made, evidenced by raw stone blocks, discarded tools, and waste stone chips.

One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men and women (including kings and queens) recorded what they did. For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties? There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone, others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that are made of hard, imperishable substances usually survive for a long time. \nArchaeologists also look for bones \u2014 of animals, birds, and fish \u2014 to find out what people ate in the past. Plant remains survive far more rarely \u2014 if seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt, they survive in a charred form. Do you think cloth is found frequently by archaeologists? \nHistorians, that is, scholars who study the past, often use the word source to refer to the information found from manuscripts, inscriptions and archaeology.

The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the motivations behind the East India Company's introduction of the Permanent Settlement in 1793, and what significant issues did it subsequently create?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that after the Company became the Diwan, it needed to organize revenue to meet its growing expenses and ensure it could buy and sell products. Following a severe economic crisis in Bengal, including a devastating famine in 1770 and declining agricultural production, Company officials felt that 'investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved'. This led to the introduction of the Permanent Settlement in 1793. The primary motivations were to 'ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land'. \n\nHowever, the Permanent Settlement created several problems. Firstly, Company officials discovered that 'the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land' because the 'revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay', leading to 'numerous zamindaris' being sold off. Secondly, as prices rose and cultivation expanded in the early nineteenth century, zamindars' incomes increased, but the Company received 'no gain' as the revenue demand was 'fixed permanently'. Lastly, the system was 'extremely oppressive' for cultivators, who faced 'high' rents, 'insecure' land rights, and often had to take loans or face eviction.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793 to ensure a regular flow of revenue and encourage zamindars to invest in improving agriculture, following a severe economic crisis and famine in Bengal. However, it created significant issues: zamindars often failed to invest due to high fixed revenue demands, leading to many zamindaris being sold; the Company did not benefit from increased production or rising prices due to the fixed revenue; and cultivators found the system oppressive due to high rents and insecure land rights."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today. Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the European companies within these new cities. The \u201cblacks\u201d or native traders and craftspersons were confined here while the \u201cwhite\u201d rulers occupied the superior residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St. William in Calcutta. The story of crafts and commerce in the eighteenth century will be taken up next year. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThere were, however, other kinds of societies as well. Many societies in the subcontinent did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. Nor were they divided into numerous unequal classes. Such societies are often called tribes. \nMembers of each tribe were united by kinship bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. Most often they combined these activities to make full use of the natural resources of the area in which they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved from one place to another. A tribal group controlled land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst households according to its own rules. \nMany large tribes thrived in different parts of the subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, deserts and places difficult to reach. Sometimes they clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and preserved their separate culture. \nBut the caste-based and tribal societies also depended on each other for their diverse needs. This relationship, of conflict and dependence, gradually caused both societies to change. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, how did tribal societies maintain their autonomy compared to how Indian craftspersons experienced a decline in their independence due to external influences?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first extract details regarding tribal societies' autonomy from the first text section.

International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThis was also the time when Aryabhata, a mathematician and astronomer, wrote a book in Sanskrit known as the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis, even though it seems as if the sun is rising and setting everyday. He developed a scientific explanation for eclipses as well. He also found a way of calculating the circumference of a circle, which is nearly as accurate as the formula we use today. Varahamihira, Brahmagupta and Bhaskaracharya were some other mathematicians and astronomers who made several discoveries. Try and find out more about them. \nWhile numerals had been used earlier, mathematicians in India now invented a special symbol for zero. This system of counting was adapted by the Arabs and then spread to Europe. It continues to be in use throughout the world. The Romans used a system of counting without using zero. Try and find out more about it. \nAyurveda is a well-known system of health science that was developed in ancient India. The two famous practitioners of Ayurveda in ancient India were Charaka (1st-2nd centuries C.E.) and Sushruta (c. 4th century C.E.) Charak Samhita, written by Charak is a remarkable book on medicine. In his treatise, Susruta Samhita, Sushruta speaks about elaborate surgical procedures. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nCompany Rule Expands \n\n If we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857, certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor- General (1798-1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. \nTipu Sultan \u2013 The \u201cTiger of Mysore\u201d The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. \nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1781 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close relationship with the French in India, and modernised his army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious, arrogant and dangerous \u2013 rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1787-89, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \nWar with the Marathas \n From the late eighteenth century the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1781, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy \n It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, carried on the resistance. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book. \nIn the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab was annexed. \nThe Doctrine of Lapse \n The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1858. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1858, the Company also took over Awadh. This time the British had an added argument \u2013 they said they were \u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nStone tools were probably made using two different techniques: 1. The first is called stone on stone. Here, the pebble from which the tool was to be made (also called the core) was held in one hand. Another stone, which was used as a hammer was held in the other hand. The second stone was used to strike off flakes from the first, till the required shape was obtained. 2. Pressure flaking: Here the core was placed on a firm surface. The hammer stone was used on a piece of bone or stone that was placed on the core, to remove flakes that could be shaped into tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAnother tradition that developed in different ways was that of miniature painting. Miniatures (as their very name suggests) are small-sized paintings, generally done in water colour on cloth or paper. The earliest miniatures were on palm leaves or wood. Some of the most beautiful of these, found in western India, were used to illustrate Jaina texts. The Mughal emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised highly skilled painters who primarily illustrated manuscripts containing historical accounts and poetry. These were generally painted in brilliant colours and portrayed court scenes, scenes of battle or hunting, and other aspects of social life. They were often exchanged as gifts and were viewed only by an exclusive few \u2013 the emperor and his close associates. \nWith the decline of the Mughal Empire, many painters moved out to the courts of the emerging regional states (see also Chapter 10). As a result Mughal artistic tastes influenced the regional courts of the Deccan and the Rajput courts of Rajasthan. At the same time, they retained and developed their distinctive characteristics. Portraits of rulers and court scenes came to be painted, following the Mughal example. Besides, themes from mythology and poetry were depicted at centres such as Mewar, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota and Kishangarh. \nAnother region that attracted miniature paintings was the Himalayan foothills around the modern-day state of Himachal Pradesh. By the late seventeenth century this region had developed a bold and intense style of miniature painting called Basohli. The most popular text to be painted here was Bhanudatta\u2019s Rasamanjari. Nadir Shah\u2019s invasion and the conquest of Delhi in 1739 resulted in the migration of Mughal artists to the hills to escape the uncertainties of the plains. Here they found ready patrons which led to the founding of the Kangra school of painting. By the mideighteenth century the Kangra artists developed a style which breathed a new spirit into miniature painting. The source of inspiration was the Vaishnavite traditions. Soft colours including cool blues and greens, and a lyrical treatment of themes distinguished Kangra painting. \nRemember that ordinary women and men painted as well \u2013 on pots, walls, floors, cloth \u2013 works of art that have occasionally survived, unlike the miniatures that were carefully preserved in palaces for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the decline of the Mughal Empire influence the development of miniature painting and the emergence of regional powers, and what methods did the East India Company employ to expand its control over these states?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Impact on Miniature Painting:** The first text states that with the decline of the Mughal Empire, painters moved to the courts of emerging regional states, influencing artistic tastes in the Deccan and Rajput courts of Rajasthan. These regional courts developed distinctive characteristics and depicted themes from mythology and poetry. The text also mentions that Nadir Shah\u2019s invasion led to Mughal artists migrating to the Himalayan foothills, contributing to the Basohli and Kangra schools of painting. \n2.  **Emergence of Regional Powers:** The second text explains that as the Mughal emperor's authority declined, his servants became powerful regional centers, forming new dynasties and commanding provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh, which consolidated independent political identities by the eighteenth century.\n3.  **East India Company Expansion:** The third text details the East India Company's expansion methods. It appointed Residents to interfere in internal affairs and forced states into 'subsidiary alliances,' taking territory if payments for 'subsidiary forces' were missed (e.g., Awadh, Hyderabad). The Company also resorted to direct military confrontation (e.g., with Mysore under Tipu Sultan and the Marathas). Furthermore, policies like 'paramountcy' (claiming supreme authority) and the 'Doctrine of Lapse' (annexing states without a male heir, such as Satara, Sambalpur, Udaipur, Nagpur, Jhansi, and Awadh) were used to systematically annex Indian kingdoms.\n\nAnswer: The decline of the Mughal Empire led to a significant shift in artistic patronage, as painters moved from the imperial court to emerging regional states, influencing and developing distinctive styles in places like the Deccan, Rajasthan, and the Himalayan foothills (e.g., Basohli and Kangra schools). Concurrently, the authority vacuum created by the Mughal decline allowed its former servants to establish powerful, independent regional states such as Hyderabad and Awadh. The East India Company then exploited this fragmented political landscape through various methods: appointing Residents to interfere in internal affairs, imposing 'subsidiary alliances' (forcing states like Awadh and Hyderabad to cede territory for failing to pay for protection), engaging in direct military confrontations (e.g., with Mysore and the Marathas), and implementing aggressive policies like 'paramountcy' and the 'Doctrine of Lapse' to systematically annex these and other Indian kingdoms."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.9.6", "7.4.10", "8.2.3", "6.12.9", "6.2.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

(Note that used in this sense, the word does not refer to the different states which are found in a country.) \nPlanning for Development \n\n Lifting India and Indians out of poverty, and building a modern technical and industrial base were among the major objectives of the new nation. In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development. There was a broad agreement on what was called a \u201cmixed economy\u201d model. Here, both the State and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs. What, specifically, these roles were to be \u2013 which industries should be initiated by the state and which by the market, how to achieve a balance between the different regions and states \u2013 was to be defined by the Planning Commission. \nIn 1956, the Second Five Year Plan was formulated. This focused strongly on the development of heavy industries such as steel, and on the building of large dams. These sectors would be under the control of the State. This focus on heavy industry, and the effort at state regulation of the economy was to guide economic policy for the next few decades. This approach had many strong supporters, but also some vocal critics. \nSome felt that it had put inadequate emphasis on agriculture. Others argued that it had neglected primary education. Still others believed that it had not taken account of the environmental implications of economic policies. As Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s follower Mira Behn wrote in 1949, by \u201cscience and machinery he [mankind] may get huge returns for a time, but ultimately will come desolation. We have got to study Nature\u2019s balance, and develop our lives within her laws, if we are to survive as a physically healthy and morally decent species.\u201d \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBefore large kingdoms emerged, different groups of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses. As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe also have archaeological evidence for crafts. These include extremely fine pottery, known as the Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). It gets its name from the fact that it is generally found in the northern part of the subcontinent. \nRemember that the archaeological evidence for many crafts may not have survived. We know from texts that the manufacture of cloth was important. There were famous centres such as Varanasi in the north, and Madurai in the south. Both men and women worked in these centres. \nMany crafts persons and merchants now formed associations known as shrenis. These shrenis of crafts persons provided training, procured raw material, and distributed the finished product. Then shrenis of merchants organised the trade. Shrenis also served as banks, where rich men and women deposited money. This was invested, and part of the interest was returned or used to support religious institutions such as monasteries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nLinguistic \u2013 Relating to language. \nHow were States to be Formed? \n\n Back in the 1920s, the Indian National Congress \u2013 the main party of the freedom struggle \u2013 had promised that once the country won independence, each major linguistic group would have its own province. However, after independence the Congress did not take any steps to honour this promise. For India had been divided on the basis of religion: despite the wishes and efforts of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom had come not to one nation but to two. As a result of the partition of India, more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims. Could the country afford further divisions on the basis of language? \nBoth Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel were against the creation of linguistic states. After the Partition, Nehru said, \u201cdisruptionist tendencies had come to the fore\u201d; to check them, the nation had to be strong and united. Or, as Patel put it: ... the first and last need of India at the present moment is that it should be made a nation \u2026 Everything which helps the growth of nationalism has to go forward and everything which throws obstacles in its way has to be rejected \u2026 We have applied this test to linguistic provinces also, and by this test, in our opinion [they] cannot be supported. \nThat the Congress leaders would now go back on their promise created great disappointment. The Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, the Marathi speakers, had all looked forward to having their own state. The strongest protests, however, came from the Telugu-speaking districts of what was the Madras Presidency. When Nehru went to campaign there during the general elections of 1952, he was met with black flags and slogans demanding \u201cWe want Andhra\u201d. In October of that year, a veteran Gandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger strike demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast went on, it attracted much support. Hartals and bandhs were observed in many towns. \nOn 15 December 1952, fifty-eight days into his fast, Potti Sriramulu died. As a newspaper put it, \u201cthe news of the passing away of Sriramulu engulfed entire Andhra in chaos\u201d. The protests were so widespread and intense that the central government was forced to give in to the demand. Thus, on 1 October 1953, the new state of Andhra came into being, which subsequently became Andhra Pradesh. \nAfter the creation of Andhra, other linguistic communities also demanded their own separate states. A States Reorganisation Commission was set up, which submitted its report in 1956, recommending the redrawing of district and provincial boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu speakers respectively. The large Hindi-speaking region of north India was also to be broken up into several states. A little later, in 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided into separate states for Marathi and Gujarati speakers. In 1966, the state of Punjab was also divided into Punjab and Haryana, the former for the Punjabi speakers (who were also mostly Sikhs), the latter for the rest (who spoke not Punjabi but versions of Haryanvi or Hindi). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThis was also the time when Aryabhata, a mathematician and astronomer, wrote a book in Sanskrit known as the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis, even though it seems as if the sun is rising and setting everyday. He developed a scientific explanation for eclipses as well. He also found a way of calculating the circumference of a circle, which is nearly as accurate as the formula we use today. Varahamihira, Brahmagupta and Bhaskaracharya were some other mathematicians and astronomers who made several discoveries. Try and find out more about them. \nWhile numerals had been used earlier, mathematicians in India now invented a special symbol for zero. This system of counting was adapted by the Arabs and then spread to Europe. It continues to be in use throughout the world. The Romans used a system of counting without using zero. Try and find out more about it. \nAyurveda is a well-known system of health science that was developed in ancient India. The two famous practitioners of Ayurveda in ancient India were Charaka (1st-2nd centuries C.E.) and Sushruta (c. 4th century C.E.) Charak Samhita, written by Charak is a remarkable book on medicine. In his treatise, Susruta Samhita, Sushruta speaks about elaborate surgical procedures. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the key functions of ancient 'shrenis' and how did the post-independence Planning Commission approach economic development?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first step is to identify the functions of ancient 'shrenis' from the text. Section 2 states that 'shrenis of crafts persons provided training, procured raw material, and distributed the finished product.' It also mentions that 'shrenis of merchants organised the trade' and that 'Shrenis also served as banks, where rich men and women deposited money. This was invested, and part of the interest was returned or used to support religious institutions such as monasteries.' \n\nThe next step is to identify the approach of the post-independence Planning Commission to economic development. Section 5 indicates that 'In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development.' It adopted a 'mixed economy' model where 'both the State and the private sector would play important and complementary roles.' The 'Second Five Year Plan' formulated in 1956, 'focused strongly on the development of heavy industries such as steel, and on the building of large dams,' with these sectors being 'under the control of the State.' The overall objectives were 'Lifting India and Indians out of poverty, and building a modern technical and industrial base.'\n\nFinally, I will combine these observations to form the answer.\n\nAnswer: Ancient 'shrenis' served multiple functions: they provided training, procured raw materials, and distributed finished products for craftspersons; they organized trade for merchants; and they acted as banks, investing deposits and using interest to support religious institutions. In contrast, the post-independence Planning Commission, established in 1950, approached economic development through a 'mixed economy' model, where both the State and private sector played roles. Its 1956 Second Five Year Plan specifically focused on developing heavy industries like steel and building large dams, with these sectors primarily under State control, aiming to lift India out of poverty and build a modern technical and industrial base."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.8.2", "6.9.8", "6.12.9", "8.10.3", "8.10.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAround 2500 years ago, the people of Athens set up a form of government, which was called a democracy, which lasted for about 200 years. \nAll free men over the age of 30 were recognised as full citizens. There was an assembly that met at least 40 times a year to decide on important matters. All citizens could attend these meetings. \nAppointments for many positions were made through lottery. All those who wanted to be chosen gave in their names, and then some were selected through lottery. \nCitizens were expected to serve in the army and the navy. However, women were not considered citizens. Also, many foreigners, who lived and worked in Athens as merchants and crafts persons did not have rights as citizens. \nBesides, there were several thousand slaves in Athens, who worked in mines, fields, households and workshops. They too were not treated as citizens. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBecause kings built temples to demonstrate their devotion to God and their power and wealth, it is not surprising that when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms they often targeted these buildings. In the early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti noted: \u201che removed all the valuables ... The statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace ... and the golden images in the various monasteries \u2013 all these he seized.\u201d The blow to the pride of the Sinhalese ruler had to be avenged and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered his general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. The Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha. \nSimilarly in the early eleventh century, when the Chola king Rajendra I built a Shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated rulers. An incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas; an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the Palas of Bengal. \nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of Rajendra I. During his campaigns in the subcontinent he attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols. Sultan Mahmud was not a very important ruler at that time. But by destroying temples \u2013 especially the one at Somnath \u2013 he tried to win credit as a great hero of Islam. In the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFind Mehrgarh on Map 2 (page14). This site is located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass, which is one of the most important routes into Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places where women and men learnt to grow barley and wheat, and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know about. \nArchaeologists who excavated the site found evidence of many kinds of animal bones from the earliest levels. These included bones of wild animals such as the deer and pig. In later levels, they found more bones of sheep and goat, and in still later levels, cattle bones are most common, suggesting that this was the animal that was generally kept by the people. \nOther finds at Mehrgarh include remains of square or rectangular houses. Each house had four or more compartments, some of which may have been used for storage. \nWhen people die, their relatives and friends generally pay respect to them. People look after them, perhaps in the belief that there is some form of life after death. Burial is one such arrangement. Several burial sites have been found at Mehrgarh. In one instance, the dead person was buried with goats, which were probably meant to serve as food in the next world. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the primary motivations for kings to build stupas and temples, and how did these structures become targets during conflicts between kingdoms in the Middle Ages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The texts indicate that kings and queens usually undertook the construction of stupas and temples because it was an expensive endeavor.

A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIndian Textiles and the World Market \n\n Let us first look at textile production. Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun.

Temples served as crucial economic centers, acting as nuclei for settlements, hubs for craft production (notably bronze images), and were endowed with land to support various temple specialists. \n2. **Identify Chola Period Specialized Labor**: Specialized labor in the Chola period included a diverse group associated with temples (priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers) and craftspeople for bronze image making. Agricultural labor involved peasants and rich peasants (Vellala caste), while administration involved village councils, nadus, and assemblies (sabhas) of Brahmana landholders.\n3. **Identify Indian Textile Industry (Pre-Decline) Economic Activities**: The second text describes the Indian textile industry before its decline as a major manufacturing and trade-oriented economy. India was the world's largest producer of cotton textiles, renowned for their quality and craftsmanship. These textiles were extensively traded globally, particularly in Southeast Asia, West and Central Asia, and Europe, generating substantial profits for European trading companies.\n4. **Identify Indian Textile Industry (Pre-Decline) Specialized Labor**: Specialized labor in this industry was production-focused, involving spinners (primarily women using charkha and takli), weavers (from specific communities like tanti, julahas, sale, kaikollar, and devangs), dyers (rangrez) for colored textiles, and specialist block printers (chhipigars) for printed cloth.\n5. **Synthesize and Compare**: The Chola period's economy was primarily agrarian and temple-centric, with a wide range of specialized roles supporting both agriculture and religious/cultural institutions. In contrast, the pre-decline Indian textile industry was a manufacturing and export-driven economy, characterized by highly specialized craftspeople dedicated to different stages of textile production and trade.\n\nAnswer: In the Chola period, primary economic activities revolved around large-scale agrarian production, particularly rice cultivation in the Kaveri delta, supported by extensive irrigation. Temples were central economic hubs, fostering craft production like bronze images and serving as nuclei for settlements. Specialized labor included temple functionaries (priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers), bronze craftspeople, peasants, and administrative roles within village councils and assemblies. Conversely, the Indian textile industry before its decline was dominated by manufacturing and global trade of high-quality cotton textiles. Its specialized labor force was focused on production, comprising spinners (mostly women), weavers, dyers (rangrez), and specialist block printers (chhipigars), all contributing to a vast export market."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.5", "8.6.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

We have used the word \u2018pasts\u2019 in plural to draw attention to the fact that the past was different for different groups of people. For example, the lives of herders or farmers were different from those of kings and queens, the lives of merchants were different from those of crafts persons, and so on. Also, as is true even today, people followed different practices and customs in different parts  of the country. For example, today most people living in the Andaman Islands get their own food by fishing, hunting, and collecting forest produce. By contrast, most people living in cities depend on others for supplies of food. Differences such as these existed in the past as well. \nBesides, there is another kind of difference. We know a great deal about kings and the battles they fought because they kept records of their victories. Generally, ordinary people such as hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers or herders did not keep records of what they did. While archaeology helps us to find out about their lives, there is much that remains unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nRaw materials are substances that are either found naturally (such as wood, or ores of metals) or produced by farmers or herders. These are then processed to produce finished goods. For example, cotton, produced by farmers, is a raw material that may be processed to make cloth. While some of the raw materials that the Harappans used were available locally, many items such as copper, tin, gold, silver and precious stones had to be brought from distant places. \nThe Harappans probably got copper from present-day Rajasthan, and even from Oman in West Asia. Tin, which was mixed with copper to produce bronze, may have been brought from present-day Afghanistan and Iran. Gold could have come all the way from present-day Karnataka, and precious stones from present-day Gujarat, Iran and Afghanistan. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMany of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Which raw materials did the Harappans obtain from distant places, and from what present-day regions are these materials believed to have originated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The section discussing 'Raw materials' explicitly states that 'many items such as copper, tin, gold, silver and precious stones had to be brought from distant places.'

Magadha became the most important mahajanapada in about two hundred years. Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies (c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest, could be captured and trained for the army. Forests also provided wood for building houses, carts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore mines in the region that could be tapped to make strong tools and weapons. \nMagadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible means to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma Nanda was another important ruler. He extended his control up to the north-west part of the subcontinent. Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in Bihar was the capital of Magadha for several years. Later the capital was shifted to Pataliputra (present-day Patna). \nMore than 2300 years ago, a ruler named Alexander, who lived in Macedonia in Europe, wanted to become a world conqueror.

Temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation, the process by which cities develop. Temples were often central to the economy and society. Rulers built temples to demonstrate their devotion to various deities. They also endowed temples with grants of land and money to carry out elaborate rituals, feed pilgrims and priests and celebrate festivals. Pilgrims who flocked to the temples also made donations. \nBronze is an alloy containing copper and tin. Bell metal contains a greater proportion of tin than other kinds of bronze. This produces a bell-like sound. Chola bronze statues (see Chapter 2) were made using the \u201clost wax\u201d technique. First, an image was made of wax. This was covered with clay and allowed to dry. Next it was heated, and a tiny hole was made in the clay cover. The molten wax was drained out through this hole. Then molten metal was poured into the clay mould through the hole. Once the metal cooled and solidified, the clay cover was carefully removed, and the image was cleaned and polished. \nTemple authorities used their wealth to finance trade and banking. Gradually a large number of priests, workers, artisans, traders, etc. settled near the temple to cater to its needs and those of the pilgrims. Thus grew temple towns. Towns emerged around temples such as those of Bhillasvamin (Bhilsa or Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh), and Somnath in Gujarat. Other important temple towns included Kanchipuram and Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. \nPilgrimage centres also slowly developed into townships. Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh) and Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) are examples of two such towns. Ajmer (Rajasthan) was the capital of the Chauhan kings in the twelfth century and later became the suba headquarters under the Mughals. It provides an excellent example of religious coexistence. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, the celebrated Sufi saint (see also Chapter 8) who settled there in the twelfth century, attracted devotees from all creeds.

One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them. There are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men and women (including kings and queens) recorded what they did. For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties? There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone, others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that are made of hard, imperishable substances usually survive for a long time. \nArchaeologists also look for bones \u2014 of animals, birds, and fish \u2014 to find out what people ate in the past. Plant remains survive far more rarely \u2014 if seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt, they survive in a charred form. Do you think cloth is found frequently by archaeologists? \nHistorians, that is, scholars who study the past, often use the word source to refer to the information found from manuscripts, inscriptions and archaeology. Once sources are found, learning about the past becomes an adventure, as we reconstruct it bit by bit.

Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed. And some cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and Lothal had elaborate store houses. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe lions that we see on our notes and coins have a long history. They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe know about people who lived in the subcontinent as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, what were the primary methods of obtaining food for hunter-gatherers, and how did these methods compare to the livelihoods described within Ashoka's empire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Hunter-gatherer food methods:** The first text section details that hunter-gatherers \"hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs,\" emphasizing that \"gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food.\"2. **Livelihoods in Ashoka's empire:** The third text section describes the diverse population of Ashoka's empire.

In contrast, during Ashoka's empire, while some forest dwellers continued gathering and hunting, there was a significant diversification into specialized urban professions (merchants, officials, craftspersons) and settled agricultural practices (farmers and herders in villages), indicating a more complex societal structure and economy.\n\nAnswer: Hunter-gatherers primarily obtained food by hunting wild animals, catching fish and birds, and gathering fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks, and eggs, with plant produce gathering being an extremely important method.

Murshidabad (West Bengal) on the banks of the Bhagirathi, which rose to prominence as a centre for silks and became the capital of Bengal in 1704, declined in the course of the century as the weavers faced competition from cheap mill-made cloth from England. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe main source of income available to Mughal rulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIn Chapter 4 you saw how the Mughal Empire reached the height of its success and started facing a variety of crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth century. These were caused by a number of factors. Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and financial resources of his empire by fighting a long war in the Deccan. \nUnder his successors, the efficiency of the imperial administration broke down. It became increasingly difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check on their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed as governors (subadars) often controlled the offices of revenue and military administration (diwani and faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, economic and military powers over vast regions of the Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their control over the provinces, the periodic remission of revenue to the capital declined. \nPeasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of northern and western India added to these problems. These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups were now able to seize the economic resources of the region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the gradual shifting of political and economic authority into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains and other groups. \nThe following is a contemporary writer\u2019s account of the financial bankruptcy of the empire: The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants\u2019 hands, like a peasant kept in his creditor\u2019s house until he can pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all order and administration that though the peasant reaps a harvest of gold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of straw. How then can the lord keep the armed force he should? How can he pay the soldiers who should go before him when he goes out, or the horsemen who should ride behind him? \nIn the midst of this economic and political crisis, the ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth. This invasion was followed by a series of plundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded north India five times between 1748 and 1761. \nThe devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah\u2019s invasion was described by contemporary observers. One described the wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows: sixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly one crore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of jewels, most of them unrivalled in the world, and the above included the Peacock throne. Another account described the invasion\u2019s impact upon Delhi: (those) \u2026 who had been masters were now in dire straits; and those who had been revered couldn\u2019t even (get water to) quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their corners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who once set the style in clothes now went naked; and those who owned property were now homeless \u2026 The New City (Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then attacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole world that existed there \u2026 \nAlready under severe pressure from all sides, the empire was further weakened by competition amongst different groups of nobles. They were divided into two major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis (nobles of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later Mughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either one or the other of these two powerful groups. The worst possible humiliation came when two Mughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713-1719) and Alamgir II (1754-1759) were assassinated, and two others Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) and Shah Alam II (1759-1816) were blinded by their nobles. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key internal and external factors that led to the decline of the Mughal Empire, and what were some immediate consequences of this decline?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The decline of the Mughal Empire was caused by a combination of internal weaknesses and external pressures, as described in the provided texts.

These texts were called Sangam because they were supposed to have been composed and compiled in assemblies (known as sangams) of poets that were held in the city of Madurai (see Map 7, page 113). The Tamil terms mentioned above are found in Sangam literature. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBecause kings built temples to demonstrate their devotion to God and their power and wealth, it is not surprising that when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms they often targeted these buildings. In the early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti noted: \u201che removed all the valuables ... The statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace ... and the golden images in the various monasteries \u2013 all these he seized.\u201d The blow to the pride of the Sinhalese ruler had to be avenged and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered his general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. The Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha. \nSimilarly in the early eleventh century, when the Chola king Rajendra I built a Shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated rulers. An incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas; an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the Palas of Bengal. \nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of Rajendra I. During his campaigns in the subcontinent he attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols. Sultan Mahmud was not a very important ruler at that time. But by destroying temples \u2013 especially the one at Somnath \u2013 he tried to win credit as a great hero of Islam. In the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe noted earlier the connection between the Tamil bhakti movement and temple worship. This in turn led to a reaction that is best represented in the Virashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and his companions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi. This movement began in Karnataka in the mid-twelfth century. The Virashaivas argued strongly for the equality of all human beings and against Brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of women. They were also against all forms of ritual and idol worship. \nThese are vachanas or sayings attributed to Basavanna: The rich, Will make temples for Shiva. What shall I, A poor man, Do? My legs are pillars, The body the shrine, The head a cupola Of gold. Listen, O Lord of the meeting rivers, Things standing shall fall, But the moving ever shall stay. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Akbar's policy of \"sulh-i kul\" contrast with the actions of other rulers described in the text regarding religious tolerance and the treatment of places of worship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Akbar's Policy**: The text explicitly states that Akbar's idea of \"sulh-i kul\" or \"universal peace\" emerged from his realization that religious scholars emphasizing ritual and dogma created divisions and disharmony. This policy promoted tolerance, did not discriminate between people of different religions, and focused on universal ethics like honesty, justice, and peace. His son Jahangir affirmed this, noting that in Akbar's dominions, \"there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed.\" Akbar also showed religious interest by commissioning the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. \n2. **Other Rulers' Practices**: In contrast, the text describes several rulers who targeted religious sites and idols as part of their military and political strategies. For example, the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and \"removed all the valuables... The statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold... and the golden images in the various monasteries \u2013 all these he seized.\" The next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, avenged this by invading Madurai and making a \"special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha.\" The Chola king Rajendra I filled his Shiva temple with \"prized statues seized from defeated rulers.\" Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni \"attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols,\" notably at Somnath, to \"win credit as a great hero of Islam.\" The text generalizes that \"most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers.\"\n3. **Contrast**: Akbar's \"sulh-i kul\" fostered an environment of religious tolerance, universal ethics, and non-discrimination among different faiths, even encouraging cultural exchange through translations. Conversely, many other rulers actively engaged in the destruction, looting, or seizure of religious idols and valuables from the temples and monasteries of their defeated adversaries, using these acts as a direct means to assert their political might, military success, or even religious heroism, rather than promoting peace or coexistence.\n\nAnswer: Akbar's \"sulh-i kul\" (universal peace) promoted religious tolerance, non-discrimination, and universal ethics, ensuring room for all creeds and closing the road to intolerance, as well as facilitating the translation of religious texts. In stark contrast, other rulers like the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha, Sena II, Chola king Rajendra I, and Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, routinely attacked, looted, and seized idols and valuables from the religious sites of defeated kingdoms to display their political might, military success, or to win religious credit."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.4.8", "6.9.4", "7.5.4", "7.8.5"], "num_distractors": 0}}

People\u2019s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective belief in a supernatural agency \u2013 religion \u2013 was often closely connected with the social and economic organisation of local communities. As the social worlds of these groups altered so too did their beliefs. \nIt was during this period that important changes occurred in what we call Hinduism today. These included the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty and the growing importance of Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society. Their knowledge of Sanskrit texts earned the Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant position was consolidated by the support of their patrons \u2013 new rulers searching for prestige. \nOne of the major developments of this period was the emergence of the idea of bhakti \u2013 of a loving, personal deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about this, and other traditions, in Chapter 8. \nThis was also the period when new religions appeared in the subcontinent. Merchants and migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the Quran as their holy book and accept the sovereignty of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard to social background. \nMany rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama \u2013 learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism, Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its followers. There were the Shia Muslims who believed that the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s son-in-law, Ali, was the legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and the Sunni Muslims who accepted the authority of the early leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and the succeeding Khalifas. There were other important differences between the various schools of law (Hanafi and Shafi\u2019i mainly in India), and in theology and mystic traditions. \nPatron - An influential, wealthy individual who supports another person \u2013 an artiste, a craftsperson, a learned man, or a noble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us begin by looking at an example of the connection between language and region. The Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in the ninth century in the south-western part of the peninsula, part of present-day Kerala. It is likely that Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers introduced the Malayalam language and script in their inscriptions. In fact, this is one of the earliest examples of the use of a regional language in official records in the subcontinent. \nAt the same time, the Cheras also drew upon Sanskritic traditions. The temple theatre of Kerala, which is traced to this period, borrowed stories from the Sanskrit epics. The first literary works in Malayalam, dated to about the twelfth century, are directly indebted to Sanskrit. Interestingly enough, a fourteenth-century text, the Lilatilakam, dealing with grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam \u2013 literally, \u201cdiamonds and corals\u201d referring to the two languages, Sanskrit and the regional language. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhile many people lived in the cities, others living in the countryside grew crops and reared animals.

While real ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have not survived, toy models have been found. As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used. This means that water was stored and supplied to the fields when the plants were growing. \nThe Harappans reared cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available around settlements.

He was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God which is the Ultimate Reality. He taught that Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless and without any attributes. He considered the world around us to be an illusion or maya, and preached renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman and attain salvation. \nRamanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars. According to him the best means of attaining salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu. Vishnu in His grace helps the devotee to attain the bliss of union with Him. He propounded the doctrine of Vishishtadvaita or qualified oneness in that the soul even when united with the Supreme God remained distinct. Ramanuja\u2019s doctrine greatly inspired the new strand of bhakti which developed in north India subsequently. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIf you look at Maps 1 and 2 closely, you will see something significant happening in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century. Notice how the boundaries of the Mughal Empire were reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent kingdoms. By 1765, notice how another power, the British, had successfully grabbed major chunks of territory in eastern India. What these maps tell us is that political conditions in eighteenthcentury India changed quite dramatically and within a relatively short span of time. \nIn this chapter we will read about the emergence of new political groups in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century \u2013 roughly from 1707, when Aurangzeb died, till the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nSiddhartha, also known as Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, was born about 2500 years ago. This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here.

Shankara, born in the eighth century, advocated Advaita, which posits the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God (Brahman), identifying Brahman as the formless, ultimate reality, and the world as an illusion (maya). His path to salvation involved renunciation and the pursuit of knowledge. In contrast, Ramanuja, born in the eleventh century, propounded Vishishtadvaita or 'qualified oneness'. He believed salvation was attained through intense devotion to Vishnu, and critically, that the soul, even when united with the Supreme God, remained distinct. Thus, the main differences lie in the concept of oneness (absolute vs. qualified), the nature of the world (illusion vs. a reality where devotion is key), and the primary means of salvation (knowledge and renunciation vs. intense devotion).\n\nAnswer: Shankara's Advaita doctrine emphasized the absolute oneness of the individual soul with the Supreme God (Brahman), which he described as formless and without attributes, considering the world an illusion (maya), and advocating for renunciation and the path of knowledge for salvation.

Firangis \u2013 Foreigners The term reflects an attitude of contempt. \nA Mutiny Becomes a Popular Rebellion \n\n Though struggles between rulers and the ruled are not unusual, sometimes such struggles become quite widespread as a popular resistance so that the power of the state breaks down. A very large number of people begin to believe that they have a common enemy and rise up against the enemy at the same time. For such a situation to develop people have to organise, communicate, take initiative and display the confidence to turn the situation around. \nSuch a situation developed in the northern parts of India in 1857. After a hundred years of conquest and administration, the English East India Company faced a massive rebellion that started in May 1857 and threatened the Company\u2019s very presence in India. Sepoys mutinied in several places beginning from Meerut and a large number of people from different sections of society rose up in rebellion. Some regard it as the biggest armed resistance to colonialism in the nineteenth century anywhere in the world. \nFrom Meerut to Delhi \n On 29 March 1857, a young soldier, Mangal Pandey, was hanged to death for attacking his officers in Barrackpore. Some days later, some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges, which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs. Eighty-five sepoys were dismissed from service and sentenced to ten years in jail for disobeying their officers. This happened on 9 May 1857. \nThe response of the other Indian soldiers in Meerut was quite extraordinary. On 10 May, the soldiers marched to the jail in Meerut and released the imprisoned sepoys. They attacked and killed British officers. They captured guns and ammunition and set fire to the buildings and properties of the British and declared war on the firangis. The soldiers were determined to bring an end to their rule in the country. But who would rule the land instead? The soldiers had an answer to this question \u2013 the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. \nThe sepoys of Meerut rode all night of 10 May to reach Delhi in the early hours next morning. As news of their arrival spread, the regiments stationed in Delhi also rose up in rebellion. Again british officers were killed, arms and ammunition seized, buildings set on fire. Triumphant soldiers gathered around the walls of the Red Fort where the Badshah lived, demanding to meet him. The emperor was not quite willing to challenge the mighty British power but the soldiers persisted. They forced their way into the palace and proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. \nThe ageing emperor had to accept this demand. He wrote letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight the British. This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had great implications. \nThe Mughal dynasty had ruled over a very large part of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains controlled dif ferent territories on behalf of the Mughal ruler. Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many of them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, they too would be able to rule their own territories once more, under Mughal authority. \nThe British had not expected this to happen. They thought the disturbance caused by the issue of the cartridges would die down. But Bahadur Shah Zafar\u2019s decision to bless the rebellion changed the entire situation dramatically. Often when people see an alternative possibility they feel inspired and enthused. It gives them the courage, hope and confidence to act. \nThe rebellion spreads \n After the British were routed from Delhi, there was no uprising for almost a week. It took that much time for news to travel. Then, a spurt of mutinies began. \nRegiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join other troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow. After them, the people of the towns and villages also rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to establish their authority and fight the British. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the late Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered armed forces and expelled the British garrison from the city. He proclaimed himself Peshwa. He declared that he was a governor under Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. In Lucknow, Birjis Qadr, the son of the deposed Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, was proclaimed the new Nawab. He too acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahadur Shah Zafar. His mother Begum Hazrat Mahal took an active part in organising the uprising against the British. In Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai joined the rebel sepoys and fought the British along with Tantia Tope, the general of Nana Saheb. In the Mandla region of Madhya Pradesh, Rani Avantibai Lodhi of Ramgarh raised and led an army of four thousand against the British who had taken over the administration of her state. \nThe British were greatly outnumbered by the rebel forces. They were defeated in a number of battles. This convinced the people that the rule of the British had collapsed for good and gave them the confidence to take the plunge and join the rebellion. A situation of widespread popular rebellion developed in the region of Awadh in particular. On 6 August 1857, we find a telegram sent by Lieutenant Colonel Tytler to his Commander-in-Chief expressing the fear felt by the British: \u201cOur men are cowed by the numbers opposed to them and the endless fighting. Every village is held against us, the zamindars have risen to oppose us.\u201d \nMany new leaders came up. For example, Ahmadullah Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, prophesied that the rule of the British would come to an end soon. He caught the imagination of the people and raised a huge force of supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British. In Delhi, a large number of ghazis or religious warriors came together to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came to Delhi. He became a key military leader of the rebellion. In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel sepoys and battled with the British for many months. Leaders and fighters from across the land joined the fight. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTemples and mosques were beautifully constructed because they were places of worship. They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\n1 How, When and Where\n\nHow Important are Dates?\nThere was a time when historians were fascinated with dates. There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, how did various rulers, including the English East India Company, utilize religious institutions, public works, or historical narratives to establish or legitimize their authority?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text 'Temples and mosques were beautifully constructed...' explains that rulers built temples and mosques to demonstrate their power, wealth, and devotion, and to proclaim a close relationship with God (e.g., King Rajarajadeva taking the god's name, Muslim Sultans described as 'Shadow of God'). It also states that constructing tanks and reservoirs, such as Sultan Iltutmish's Hauz-i-Sultani, won universal respect and was associated with the rule of a just king.\n2. The section 'In other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions' directly mentions that 'All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple' of Jagannatha at Puri because 'They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people.'\n3. The text 'Mutiny \u2013 When soldiers as a group disobey their officers in the army.' shows how the rebels in 1857 proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. His acceptance and call for a confederacy had 'great implications,' as smaller rulers felt they could rule their territories 'under Mughal authority,' indicating the legitimizing power of the Mughal name.\n4. The section 'How, When and Where' describes how British historians, like James Mill, periodized Indian history. Mill's view was that British rule represented 'all the forces of progress and civilisation' necessary to 'civilise India,' portraying the period before British rule as 'darkness.' This narrative served to legitimize British authority by presenting their rule as a civilizing mission.\n\nAnswer: Different rulers established or legitimized their authority through various means. Kings constructed grand temples and mosques, like the Rajarajeshvara temple, to display their power, wealth, devotion, and a close relationship with God, with Muslim Sultans being referred to as the 'Shadow of God.' They also built public works such as tanks and reservoirs, like Sultan Iltutmish's Hauz-i-Sultani, to gain respect and symbolize a just reign. Conquerors, including the English East India Company, sought control over significant religious sites like the Jagannatha temple at Puri to make their rule acceptable to the local populace. Furthermore, the 1857 rebels used the symbolic authority of the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar to legitimize their uprising. British historians, as exemplified by James Mill, created historical narratives that presented British rule as a period of progress and civilization, necessary for India's enlightenment, thereby legitimizing their colonial presence."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.7.2", "8.5.3", "7.9.3", "8.1.1", "7.5.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Some of these are shown on Map 4. Most mahajanapadas had a capital city, many of these were fortified. This means that huge walls of wood, brick or stone were built around them. \nForts were probably built because people were afraid of attacks from other kings and needed protection. It is also likely that some rulers wanted to show how rich and powerful they were by building really large, tall and impressive walls around their cities. Also in this way, the land and the people living inside the fortified area could be controlled more easily by the king. Building such huge walls required a great deal of planning. Thousands, if not lakhs of bricks or stones had to be prepared. This in turn meant enormous labour, provided, possibly, by thousands of men, women and children. And resources had to be found for all of this. \nThe new rajas now began maintaining armies. Soldiers were paid regular salaries and maintained by the king throughout the year. Some payments were probably made using punch marked coins (see the illustration on page 92). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIf you look at Maps 1 and 2 closely, you will see something significant happening in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century. Notice how the boundaries of the Mughal Empire were reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent kingdoms. By 1765, notice how another power, the British, had successfully grabbed major chunks of territory in eastern India. What these maps tell us is that political conditions in eighteenthcentury India changed quite dramatically and within a relatively short span of time. \nIn this chapter we will read about the emergence of new political groups in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century \u2013 roughly from 1707, when Aurangzeb died, till the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for building fortified cities in ancient India, and what unique construction technique was employed for the walls of Hampi, the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first part of the question, regarding reasons for fortifications, can be answered by referring to the section on 'Mahajanapadas'.

They arranged for them to stay together in the sangha, an association of those who left their homes. \nThe rules made for the Buddhist sangha were written down in a book called the Vinaya Pitaka. From this we know that there were separate branches for men and women. All men could join the sangha. However, children had to take the permission of their parents and slaves that of their masters. Those who worked for the king had to take his permission and debtors that of creditors. Women had to take their husbands\u2019 permission. \nMen and women who joined the sangha led simple lives. They meditated for most of the time, and went to cities and villages to beg for food during fixed hours. That is why they were known as bhikkhus (the Prakrit word for renouncer \u2014 beggar) and bhikkhunis. They taught others, and helped one another. They also held meetings to settle any quarrels that took place within the sangha. \nThose who joined the sangha included brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants, labourers, barbers, courtesans and slaves. Many of them wrote down the teachings of the Buddha.

The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Delhi Sultans utilize religious structures to reinforce their authority and foster community, and how did the teachings of Kabir later challenge established religious practices and perceptions of community?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first section of the text explains that the Delhi Sultans built mosques across the subcontinent. These mosques served to \"demonstrate their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims\" and to \"create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct.\" This indicates their use of religious structures for authority and community building. The fifth section, discussing Kabir, states that his teachings were a \"complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions.\" He \"openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system.\" Furthermore, Kabir believed in a \"formless Supreme God\" and preached \"bhakti or devotion\" as the path to salvation, drawing followers from \"both Hindus and Muslims.\" This directly challenges the established external worship, priestly authority, and traditional communal divisions reinforced by institutions like the mosques built by the Sultans, offering an alternative, inclusive spiritual path.\n\nAnswer: The Delhi Sultans built mosques to demonstrate their claims as protectors of Islam and Muslims, and to foster a sense of community among diverse believers. In contrast, Kabir's teachings centuries later challenged established religious practices by vehemently rejecting all forms of external worship in both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, ridiculing the pre-eminence of priestly classes and the caste system. He advocated for devotion to a formless Supreme God, drawing followers from both Hindu and Muslim backgrounds, thereby challenging traditional religious divisions and perceptions of community."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.3.3", "7.2.1", "6.7.6", "6.4.4", "7.8.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

People said he had miraculous powers \u2013 he could cure all diseases and multiply grain. Birsa himself declared that God had appointed him to save his people from trouble, free them from the slavery of dikus (outsiders). Soon thousands began following Birsa, believing that he was bhagwan (God) and had come to solve all their problems. \nBirsa was born in a family of Mundas \u2013 a tribal group that lived in Chottanagpur. But his followers included other tribals of the region \u2013 Santhals and Oraons. All of them in different ways were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under British rule. Their familiar ways of life seemed to be disappearing, their livelihoods were under threat, and their religion appeared to be in danger. \nWhat problems did Birsa set out to resolve? Who were the outsiders being referred to as dikus, and how did they enslave the people of the region? What was happening to the tribal people under the British? How did their lives change? These are some of the questions you will read about in this chapter. You have read about tribal societies last year. Most tribes had customs and rituals that were very different from those laid down by Brahmans. These societies also did not have the sharp social divisions that were characteristic of caste societies. All those who belonged to the same tribe thought of themselves as sharing common ties of kinship. However, this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago. He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThis was also the time when Aryabhata, a mathematician and astronomer, wrote a book in Sanskrit known as the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis, even though it seems as if the sun is rising and setting everyday. He developed a scientific explanation for eclipses as well. He also found a way of calculating the circumference of a circle, which is nearly as accurate as the formula we use today. Varahamihira, Brahmagupta and Bhaskaracharya were some other mathematicians and astronomers who made several discoveries. Try and find out more about them. \nWhile numerals had been used earlier, mathematicians in India now invented a special symbol for zero. This system of counting was adapted by the Arabs and then spread to Europe. It continues to be in use throughout the world. The Romans used a system of counting without using zero. Try and find out more about it. \nAyurveda is a well-known system of health science that was developed in ancient India. The two famous practitioners of Ayurveda in ancient India were Charaka (1st-2nd centuries C.E.) and Sushruta (c. 4th century C.E.) Charak Samhita, written by Charak is a remarkable book on medicine. In his treatise, Susruta Samhita, Sushruta speaks about elaborate surgical procedures. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe sants had much in common with the Sufis, so much so that it is believed that they adopted many ideas of each other. Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was in no other place. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAround 3900 years ago we find the beginning of a major change. People stopped living in many of the cities. Writing, seals and weights were no longer used. Raw materials brought from long distances became rare. In Mohenjodaro, we find that garbage piled up on the streets, the drainage system broke down, and new, less impressive houses were built, even over the streets. \nWhy did all this happen? We are not sure. Some scholars suggest that the rivers dried up. Others suggest that there was deforestation. This could have happened because fuel was required for baking bricks, and for smelting copper ores. Besides, grazing by large herds of cattle, sheep and goat may have destroyed the green cover. In some areas there were floods. But none of these reasons can explain the end of all the cities. Flooding, or a river drying up would have had an effect in only some areas. \nIt appears as if the rulers lost control. In any case, the effects of the change are quite clear. Sites in Sind and west Punjab (present-day Pakistan) were abandoned, while many people moved into newer, smaller settlements to the east and the south. \nNew cities emerged about 1400 years later. You will read about them in Chapters 6 and 9. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided accounts, what factors contributed to the sepoys' distrust and plotting against the British Government?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for factors contributing to sepoy distrust and plotting against the British, as described in the text.

Rammohun Roy translated an old Buddhist text that was critical of caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of Bhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes. In Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in 1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these reformers and members of reform associations were people of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these reformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch, in an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in their lives. \nThere were also others who questioned the injustices of the caste social order. During the course of the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries began setting up schools for tribal groups and \u201clower\u201d-caste children. These children were thus equipped with some resources to make their way into a changing world. \nAt the same time, the poor began leaving their villages to look for jobs that were opening up in the cities. There was work in the factories that were coming up, and jobs in municipalities. You have read about the expansion of cities in Chapter 6. Think of the new demands of labour this created. Drains had to be dug, roads laid, buildings constructed, and cities cleaned. This required coolies, diggers, carriers, bricklayers, sewage cleaners, sweepers, palanquin bearers, rickshaw pullers. Where did this labour come from? The poor from the villages and small towns, many of them from low castes, began moving to the cities where there was a new demand for labour. Some also went to work in plantations in Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad and Indonesia. Work in the new locations was often very hard. But the poor, the people from low castes, saw this as an opportunity to get away from the oppressive hold that upper-caste landowners exercised over their lives and the daily humiliation they suffered. \nThere were other jobs too. The army, for instance, offered opportunities. A number of Mahar people, who were regarded as untouchable, found jobs in the Mahar Regiment. The father of B.R. Ambedkar, the leader of the Dalit movement, taught at an army school. \nDemands for equality and justice \n Gradually, by the second half of the nineteenth century, people from within the Non-Brahman castes began organising movements against caste discrimination, and demanded social equality and justice. \nThe Satnami movement in Central India was founded by Ghasidas who worked among the leatherworkers and organised a movement to improve their social status. In eastern Bengal, Haridas Thakur\u2019s Matua sect worked among Chandala cultivators. Haridas questioned Brahmanical texts that supported the caste system. In what is present-day Kerala, a guru from Ezhava caste, Shri Narayana Guru, proclaimed the ideals of unity for his people. He argued against treating people unequally on the basis of caste differences. According to him, all humankind belonged to the same caste. One of his famous statements was: \u201coru jati, oru matam, oru daivam manushyanu\u201d (one caste, one religion, one god for humankind). \nAll these sects were founded by leaders who came from Non-Brahman castes and worked amongst them. They tried to change those habits and practices which provoked the contempt of dominant castes. They tried to create a sense of self-esteem among the subordinate castes. \nGulamgiri \n One of the most vocal amongst the \u201clow-caste\u201d leaders was Jyotirao Phule. Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up by Christian missionaries. On growing up he developed his own ideas about the injustices of caste society. He set out to attack the Brahmans\u2019 claim that they were superior to others, since they were Aryans. Phule argued that the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside the subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true children of the country \u2013 those who had lived here from before the coming of the Aryans. As the Aryans established their dominance, they began looking at the defeated population as inferior, as low-caste people. According to Phule, the \u201cupper\u201d castes had no right to their land and power: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people, the so-called low castes. \nPhule claimed that before Aryan rule there existed a golden age when warrior-peasants tilled the land and ruled the Maratha countryside in just and fair ways. He proposed that Shudras (labouring castes) and Ati Shudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste discrimination. The Satyashodhak Samaj, an association Phule founded, propagated caste equality. \nIn 1873, Phule wrote a book named Gulamgiri, meaning slavery. Some ten years before this, the American Civil War had been fought, leading to the end of slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves, thus establishing a link between the conditions of the \u201clower\u201d castes in India and the black slaves in America. \nAs this example shows, Phule extended his criticism of the caste system to argue against all forms of inequality. He was concerned about the plight of \u201cupper\u201d-caste women, the miseries of the labourer, and the humiliation of the \u201clow\u201d castes. This movement for caste reform was continued in the twentieth century by other great dalit leaders like Dr B.R. Ambedkar in western India and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in the south. \nWho could enter temples? \n Ambedkar was born into a Mahar family. As a child he experienced what caste prejudice meant in everyday life. In school he was forced to sit outside the classroom on the ground, and was not allowed to drink water from taps that upper -caste children used. After finishing school, he got a fellowship to go to the US for higher studies. On his return to India in 1919, he wrote extensively about \u201cupper\u201d- caste power in contemporary society. \nIn 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry movement, in which his Mahar caste followers participated. Brahman priests were outraged when the Dalits used water from the temple tank. Ambedkar led three such movements for temple entry between 1927 and 1935. His aim was to make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society. \nThe Non-Brahman movement \n In the early twentieth century, the non-Brahman movement started. The initiative came from those non-Brahman castes that had acquired access to education, wealth and influence. They argued that Brahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the north who had conquered southern lands from the original inhabitants of the region \u2013 the indigenous Dravidian races. They also challenged Brahmanical claims to power. \nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he was called, came from a middle-class family. Interestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early life and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully. Later, he became a member of the Congress, only to leave it in disgust when he found that at a feast organised by nationalists, seating arrangements followed caste distinctions \u2013 that is, the lower castes were made to sit at a distance from the upper castes. Convinced that untouchables had to fight for their dignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement. He argued that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt that all religious authorities saw social divisions and inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to free themselves, therefore, from all religions in order to achieve social equality. \nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures, especially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver, and the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said that these texts had been used to establish the authority of Brahmans over lower castes and the domination of men over women. \nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The forceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-caste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self-criticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. But orthodox Hindu society also reacted by founding Sanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal in the north, and associations like the Brahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these associations was to uphold caste distinctions as a cornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was sanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over caste continued beyond the colonial period and are still going on in our own times. \nOrganising for reform \n The Brahmo Samaj \n The Brahmo Samaj, formed in 1830, prohibited all forms of idolatry and sacrifice, believed in the Upanishads, and forbade its members from criticising other religious practices. It critically drew upon the ideals of religions \u2013 especially of Hinduism and Christianity \u2013 looking at their negative and positive dimensions. \nDerozio and Young Bengal \n Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the 1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all authority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked tradition and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned for the freedom of thought and expression. \nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda \n Named after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s guru, the Ramakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service and selfless action. \nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra Nath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his well founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world. After hearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the New York Herald reported, \u201cWe feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation\u201d. Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in modern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the Vedanta philosophy on a global scale. But his mission was not simply to talk of religion. He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery of his country men. He firmly believed that any reform could become successful only by uplifting the condition of the masses. Therefore, his clarion call to the people of India was to rise above the narrow confines of their \u2018religion of the kitchen\u2019 and come together in the service of the nation. By sending out this call he made a signal contribution to the nascent nationalism of India. His sense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception. He was convinced that many of the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the nations of the world come together on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth was to unite on the basis of a common spiritual heritage. In this exhortation he became truly \u2018the symbol of a new spirit and a source of strength for the future\u2019. \nThe Prarthana Samaj \n Established in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, abolish child marriage, encourage the education of women, and end the ban on widow remarriage. Its religious meetings drew upon Hindu, Buddhist and Christian texts. \nThe Veda Samaj \n Established in Madras (Chennai) in 1864, the Veda Samaj was inspired by the Brahmo Samaj. It worked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women\u2019s education. Its members believed in one God. They condemned the superstitions and rituals of orthodox Hinduism. \nThe Aligarh Movement \n The Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, founded by Sayyid Ahmed Khan in 1875 at Aligarh, later became the Aligarh Muslim University. The institution offered modern education, including Western science, to Muslims. The Aligarh Movement, as it was known, had an enormous impact in the area of educational reform. \nThe Singh Sabha Movement \n Reform organisations of the Sikhs, the first Singh Sabhas were formed at Amritsar in 1873 and at Lahore in 1879. The Sabhas sought to rid Sikhism of superstitions, caste distinctions and practices seen by them as non-Sikh. They promoted education among the Sikhs, often combining modern instruction with Sikh teachings. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the diverse approaches adopted by various individuals and reform movements to challenge caste inequalities in India, as described in the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes several distinct approaches to challenging caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy translated a Buddhist text critical of caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the Bhakti tradition, believing in spiritual equality, and explicitly sought to remove caste restrictions. The Paramhans Mandali worked for the abolition of caste and its members secretly violated caste taboos on food and touch. Christian missionaries set up schools for tribal and 'lower'-caste children to equip them with resources. The poor and 'low castes' migrated to cities and plantations, and joined the army (e.g., Mahar Regiment), viewing these as opportunities to escape upper-caste oppression. Movements like the Satnami movement (Ghasidas) worked to improve the social status of leatherworkers, while Haridas Thakur's Matua sect questioned Brahmanical texts. Shri Narayana Guru proclaimed ideals of unity, arguing against caste-based inequality and stating 'one caste, one religion, one god for humankind.' Leaders from Non-Brahman castes generally aimed to create self-esteem among subordinate castes and change practices that provoked contempt. Jyotirao Phule challenged Brahman claims of superiority by arguing Aryans were foreign invaders, advocated for the unity of Shudras and Ati Shudras, founded the Satyashodhak Samaj, and through his book 'Gulamgiri,' linked the plight of Indian 'lower' castes to American slaves. B.R. Ambedkar, born into a Mahar family, wrote about upper-caste power and led temple entry movements to expose caste prejudices.

Men, women and children probably observed several things: the places where edible plants were found, how seeds broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. Perhaps they began looking after plants \u2014 protecting them from birds and animals so that they could grow and the seeds could ripen. In this way people became farmers. \nWomen, men and children could also attract and then tame animals by leaving food for them near their shelters. The first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that were relatively gentle to come near the camps where they lived. These animals such as sheep, goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and most of them ate grass. Often, people protected these animals from attacks by other wild animals. This is how they became herders. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, European countries were searching for spices and textiles, which had become popular both in Europe and West Asia. The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today. Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the European companies within these new cities. The \u201cblacks\u201d or native traders and craftspersons were confined here while the \u201cwhite\u201d rulers occupied the superior residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St. William in Calcutta. The story of crafts and commerce in the eighteenth century will be taken up next year. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) than about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwara. \nBefore his death in 1539, Baba Guru Nanak appointed one of his followers as his successor. His name was Lehna but he came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that he was a part of Baba Guru Nanak himself. Guru Angad compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur\u2019s son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as \u2018a state within the state\u2019. The Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement. The ideas of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this development from the very beginning. He emphasised the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications. This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most important ruling dynasties in south India during this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was centred around the Raichur Doab, between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. \nAihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed as a religious centre, with a number of temples. The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one another\u2019s lands, especially attacking the capital cities, which were prosperous towns. \nThe best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about his ancestors, who are traced back through four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin evidently got the kingdom from his uncle. \nAccording to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he checked the advance of Harsha. There is an interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha means happiness. The poet says that after this defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter behind the walls of Kanchipuram. \nBut the Chalukya victory was short-lived. Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta and Chola dynasties, about which you will study in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for the decline in independence of Indian craftspersons during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and what event highlighted the growing political significance of the Sikh community in the early seventeenth century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text on 'European Companies and Indian Trade/Crafts' explains the decline of craftspersons' independence.

Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThis was also the time when Aryabhata, a mathematician and astronomer, wrote a book in Sanskrit known as the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis, even though it seems as if the sun is rising and setting everyday. He developed a scientific explanation for eclipses as well. He also found a way of calculating the circumference of a circle, which is nearly as accurate as the formula we use today. Varahamihira, Brahmagupta and Bhaskaracharya were some other mathematicians and astronomers who made several discoveries. Try and find out more about them. \nWhile numerals had been used earlier, mathematicians in India now invented a special symbol for zero. This system of counting was adapted by the Arabs and then spread to Europe. It continues to be in use throughout the world. The Romans used a system of counting without using zero. Try and find out more about it. \nAyurveda is a well-known system of health science that was developed in ancient India. The two famous practitioners of Ayurveda in ancient India were Charaka (1st-2nd centuries C.E.) and Sushruta (c. 4th century C.E.) Charak Samhita, written by Charak is a remarkable book on medicine.

He felt that just as a father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the teachings of the Buddha (Chapter 7). \nThere were a number of problems that troubled him. People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Animals were sacrificed. Slaves and servants were ill treated. Besides, there were quarrels in families and amongst neighbours. Ashoka felt it was his duty to solve these problems. So, he appointed officials, known as the dhamma mahamatta who went from place to place teaching people about dhamma. Besides, Ashoka got his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars, instructing his officials to read his message to those who could not read it themselves. \nAshoka also sent messengers to spread ideas about dhamma to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece and Sri Lanka. Try and identify these on Map 6, pages 84-85. He built roads, dug wells, and built rest houses.

We have used the word \u2018pasts\u2019 in plural to draw attention to the fact that the past was different for different groups of people. For example, the lives of herders or farmers were different from those of kings and queens, the lives of merchants were different from those of crafts persons, and so on. Also, as is true even today, people followed different practices and customs in different parts  of the country. For example, today most people living in the Andaman Islands get their own food by fishing, hunting, and collecting forest produce. By contrast, most people living in cities depend on others for supplies of food. Differences such as these existed in the past as well. \nBesides, there is another kind of difference. We know a great deal about kings and the battles they fought because they kept records of their victories. Generally, ordinary people such as hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers or herders did not keep records of what they did. While archaeology helps us to find out about their lives, there is much that remains unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind the river Narmada on Map 1 (page 2). People have lived along the banks of this river for several hundred thousand years. Some of the earliest people who lived here were skilled gatherers, \u2014 that is, people who gathered their food. They knew about the vast wealth of plants in the surrounding forests, and collected roots, fruits and other forest produce for their food. They also hunted animals. \nNow find the Sulaiman and Kirthar hills to the northwest. Some of the areas where women and men first began to grow crops such as wheat and barley about 8000 years ago are located here. People also began rearing animals like sheep, goat, and cattle, and lived in villages. Locate the Garo hills to the north-east and the Vindhyas in central India. These were some of the other areas where agriculture developed. The places where rice was first grown are to the north of the Vindhyas. \nTrace the river Indus and its tributaries (tributaries are smaller rivers that flow into a larger river). About 4700 years ago, some of the earliest cities flourished on the banks of these rivers. Later, about 2500 years ago, cities developed on the banks of the Ganga and its tributaries, and along the sea coasts. \nLocate the Ganga and its tributary called the Son. In ancient times the area along these rivers to the south of the Ganga was known as Magadha now lying in the state of Bihar. Its rulers were very powerful, and set up a large kingdom. Kingdoms were set up in other parts of the country as well. \nThroughout, people travelled from one part of the subcontinent to another. The hills and high mountains including the Himalayas, deserts, rivers and seas made journeys dangerous at times, but never impossible. So, men and women moved in search of livelihood, as also to escape from natural disasters like floods or droughts. Sometimes men marched in armies, conquering others\u2019 lands. Besides, merchants travelled with caravans or ships, carrying valuable goods from place to place. And religious teachers walked from village to village, town to town, stopping to offer instruction and advice on the way. Finally, some people perhaps travelled driven by a spirit of adventure, wanting to discover new and exciting places. All these led to the sharing of ideas between people. \nWhy do people travel nowadays? Look at Map 1 once more. Hills, mountains and seas form the natural frontiers of the subcontinent. While it was difficult to cross these frontiers, those who wanted could and did scale the mountains and cross the seas. People from across the frontiers also came into the subcontinent and settled here. \nThese movements of people enriched our cultural traditions. People have shared new ways of carving stone, composing music, and even cooking food over several hundreds of years. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nFind the Kurnool caves on Map 2 (page14).

(Note that used in this sense, the word does not refer to the different states which are found in a country.) \nPlanning for Development \n\n Lifting India and Indians out of poverty, and building a modern technical and industrial base were among the major objectives of the new nation. In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development. There was a broad agreement on what was called a \u201cmixed economy\u201d model. Here, both the State and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs. What, specifically, these roles were to be \u2013 which industries should be initiated by the state and which by the market, how to achieve a balance between the different regions and states \u2013 was to be defined by the Planning Commission. \nIn 1956, the Second Five Year Plan was formulated. This focused strongly on the development of heavy industries such as steel, and on the building of large dams. These sectors would be under the control of the State. This focus on heavy industry, and the effort at state regulation of the economy was to guide economic policy for the next few decades. This approach had many strong supporters, but also some vocal critics. \nSome felt that it had put inadequate emphasis on agriculture. Others argued that it had neglected primary education. Still others believed that it had not taken account of the environmental implications of economic policies.

Section 1 generally notes that kings kept records of their victories, implying their official actions and achievements. More specifically, Section 4 details Ashoka's functions of governance: he felt a duty to instruct his subjects, solve problems such as religious conflict, animal sacrifice, ill-treatment of slaves, and family quarrels. To achieve this, he appointed officials called dhamma mahamatta to teach dhamma, spread messages through rock and pillar inscriptions, and engaged in public welfare by building roads, digging wells, constructing rest houses, and arranging medical treatment for humans and animals.\n\nNext, I will identify details about governance in modern, post-independence India. Section 3 defines the 'State' as being concerned with government. After independence, the major objectives of the new nation included lifting India and Indians out of poverty and building a modern technical and industrial base. To achieve these, the government set up a Planning Commission in 1950 to design and execute policies for economic development, adopting a 'mixed economy' model where the State played an important role. The Second Five Year Plan (1956) further specified the State's control over heavy industries like steel and the building of large dams.\n\nFinally, I will contrast these two periods. Ashoka's governance was characterized by a focus on moral instruction, social harmony, and public welfare, driven by a sense of duty and inspired by Buddhist teachings, often through direct instruction and public works. In contrast, post-independence Indian governance, as described, focused on economic development, industrialization, and poverty alleviation, utilizing institutional mechanisms like the Planning Commission to formulate policies and guide a mixed economy with significant State control over key industrial sectors.\n\nAnswer: In ancient times, Ashoka's governance focused on moral instruction, resolving social conflicts, and providing public welfare through officials, inscriptions, and infrastructure projects like roads and medical treatment. In contrast, post-independence Indian governance, through institutions like the Planning Commission, aimed at economic development, poverty alleviation, and building a modern industrial base, adopting a 'mixed economy' model with the State controlling heavy industries and large dams."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.1.5", "6.2.5", "8.10.4", "6.8.7", "6.1.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in the ninth century in the south-western part of the peninsula, part of present-day Kerala. It is likely that Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers introduced the Malayalam language and script in their inscriptions. In fact, this is one of the earliest examples of the use of a regional language in official records in the subcontinent. \nAt the same time, the Cheras also drew upon Sanskritic traditions. The temple theatre of Kerala, which is traced to this period, borrowed stories from the Sanskrit epics. The first literary works in Malayalam, dated to about the twelfth century, are directly indebted to Sanskrit. Interestingly enough, a fourteenth-century text, the Lilatilakam, dealing with grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam \u2013 literally, \u201cdiamonds and corals\u201d referring to the two languages, Sanskrit and the regional language. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n2 From Trade to Territory \n The Company Establishes Power \n\n Aurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He established control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, many Mughal governors (subadars) and big zamindars began asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre. \nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, however, a new power was emerging on the political horizon \u2013 the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will see how this came about. \nAfter Aurangzeb there was no powerful Mughal ruler, but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact, when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal emperor at the time, was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company, Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom, and his sons were shot in cold blood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIf the context in which information is produced changes with time, what about language and meanings? Historical records exist in a variety of languages which have changed considerably over the years. Medieval Persian, for example, is different from modern Persian. The difference is not just with regard to grammar and vocabulary; the meanings of words also change over time. \nTake the term \u201cHindustan\u201d, for example. Today we understand it as \u201cIndia\u201d, the modern nation-state. When the term was used in the thirteenth century by Minhaj-i-Siraj, a chronicler who wrote in Persian, he meant the areas of Punjab, Haryana and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. He used the term in a political sense for lands that were a part of the dominions of the Delhi Sultan. The areas included in this term shifted with the extent of the Sultanate but the term never included south India. By contrast, in the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used the word \u201cHind\u201d. While the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like \u201cIndia\u201d did exist, the term \u201cHindustan\u201d did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with it today. \nHistorians today have to be careful about the terms they use because they meant different things in the past. Take, for example, a simple term like \u201cforeigner\u201d. It is used today to mean someone who is not an Indian. In the medieval period a \u201cforeigner\u201d was any stranger who appeared say in a given village, someone who was not a part of that society or culture. (In Hindi the term pardesi might be used to describe such a person and in Persian, ajnabi.) A city-dweller, therefore, might have regarded a forest-dweller as a \u201cforeigner\u201d, but two peasants living in the same village were not foreigners to each other, even though they may have had different religious or caste backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere were two major changes in agriculture around this time. One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures.

By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBABUR 1526-1530 : 1526 \u2013 defeated Ibrahim Lodi and his Afghan supporters at Panipat. 1527 \u2013 defeated Rana Sanga, Rajput rulers and allies at Khanua. 1528 \u2013 defeated the Rajputs at Chanderi; Established control over Agra and Delhi before his death. \nHUMAYUN 1530-1540, 1555-1556 : (1) Humayun divided his inheritance according to the will of his father. His brothers were each given a province. The ambitions of his brother Mirza Kamran weakened Humayun\u2019s cause against Afghan competitors. Sher Khan defeated Humayun at Chausa (1539) and Kanauj (1540), forcing him to flee to Iran. (2) In Iran Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah. He recaptured Delhi in 1555 but died the next year after an accident in this building. \nAKBAR 1556-1605 : Akbar was 13 years old when he became emperor. His reign can be divided into three periods. (1) 1556-1570 \u2013 Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed. Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan, rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir\u2019s wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful. \nShah Jahan 1627-1658 : Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632 Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan\u2019s sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra. \nAurangzeb 1658-1707 : (1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas. His death was followed by a succession conflict amongst his sons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nProvincial autonomy - Capacity of the provinces to make relatively independent decisions while remaining within a federation. \nThe March to Dandi \n Purna Swaraj would never come on its own. It had to be fought for. In 1930, Gandhiji declared that he would lead a march to break the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi along with other nationalists reasoned that it was sinful to tax salt since it is such an essential item of our food. The Salt March related the general desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by everybody, and thus did not divide the rich and the poor. \nGandhiji and his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt. Peasants, tribals and women participated in large numbers. A business federation published a pamphlet on the salt issue. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were sent to jail. \nThe combined struggles of the Indian people bore fruit when the Government of India Act of 1935 prescribed provincial autonomy and the government announced elections to the provincial legislatures in 1937. The Congress formed governments in 7 out of 11 provinces. \nIn September 1939, after two years of Congress rule in the provinces, the Second World War broke out. Critical of Hitler, Congress leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to concede the demand. The Congress ministries resigned in protest. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary difficulties encountered by indigo planters when expanding cultivation under the 'nij' and 'ryoti' systems, and how did the British East India Company support indigo production in India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for two main things: difficulties in 'nij' and 'ryoti' cultivation, and the Company's support. I will find information for each part in the provided text.\n\n1.  **Difficulties with 'nij' cultivation:** The text under 'The problem with nij cultivation' states that planters found it difficult to expand this system because indigo required fertile lands which were already densely populated, making it hard to acquire large, compact blocks of land. Attempts to lease land and evict peasants led to conflicts. Mobilizing labor was also difficult as it was needed when peasants were busy with rice cultivation. Furthermore, large-scale nij cultivation required a significant investment in ploughs and bullocks (e.g., 2,000 ploughs for 1,000 bighas), which were hard to acquire as peasants' animals were also busy.\n\n2.  **Difficulties with 'ryoti' cultivation:** The section 'Indigo on the land of ryots' explains that under this system, planters forced ryots to sign contracts (satta) and gave them cash advances. However, the price ryots received for indigo was very low, trapping them in an endless cycle of loans. Planters also insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils, which peasants preferred for rice, and indigo exhausted the soil, preventing subsequent rice cultivation.\n\n3.  **Company's support for indigo production:** The section 'Britain turns to India' mentions that faced with rising demand, the Company looked for ways to expand indigo cultivation. Commercial agents and Company officials began investing in indigo production, with many officials even leaving their jobs to manage indigo businesses. The Company and banks provided loans to those who lacked money to produce indigo, attracting Scotsmen and Englishmen to become planters.\n\nAnswer: Indigo planters faced several difficulties in expanding cultivation. Under the 'nij' system, challenges included the scarcity of fertile, densely populated land for large, compact blocks, conflicts arising from attempts to evict peasants, and difficulties in mobilizing labor and acquiring the necessary ploughs and bullocks, as these resources were often tied up with rice cultivation. Under the 'ryoti' system, peasants were often forced into contracts (satta) and, despite cash advances, received very low prices for their indigo, leading to an unending cycle of debt. Planters also insisted on cultivating indigo on the best soils, which peasants preferred for rice, and indigo's deep roots exhausted the soil, preventing subsequent rice crops. The British East India Company facilitated indigo production by actively looking for ways to expand cultivation, with its commercial agents and officials investing in indigo businesses, and by providing loans through the Company and banks to individuals seeking to become planters."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.9.4", "7.4.3", "8.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This site is located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass, which is one of the most important routes into Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places where women and men learnt to grow barley and wheat, and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know about. \nArchaeologists who excavated the site found evidence of many kinds of animal bones from the earliest levels. These included bones of wild animals such as the deer and pig. In later levels, they found more bones of sheep and goat, and in still later levels, cattle bones are most common, suggesting that this was the animal that was generally kept by the people. \nOther finds at Mehrgarh include remains of square or rectangular houses. Each house had four or more compartments, some of which may have been used for storage. \nWhen people die, their relatives and friends generally pay respect to them. People look after them, perhaps in the belief that there is some form of life after death. Burial is one such arrangement. Several burial sites have been found at Mehrgarh. In one instance, the dead person was buried with goats, which were probably meant to serve as food in the next world. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFa Xian began his journey back home from Bengal.

The merchants began throwing their merchandise overboard so as to lighten the load and save the ship from sinking. Fa Xian threw away his meagre personal belongings, but clung to his books and the statues of the Buddha that he had collected. Finally, the storm subsided after 13 days. This is how he describes the sea: \u201cThe sea itself is boundless in extent \u2014 it is impossible to know east or west, except by observing the sun, moon, or stars in their motions.

The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIn Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Take a look at Table 1 again and identify the five dynasties that together made the Delhi Sultanate. \nThe rulers of Delhi - Table 1 - RAJPUT DYNASTIES : Tomaras Early twelfth century-1165, Ananga Pala 1130-1145, Chauhans 1165-1192, Prithviraj Chauhan 1175-1192 - EARLY TURKISH RULERS 1206-1290 : Qutbuddin Aybak 1206-1210, Shamsuddin Iltutmish 1210-1236, Raziyya 1236-1240, Ghiyasuddin Balban 1266-1287 - KHALJI DYNASTY 1290-1320 : Jalaluddin Khalji 1290-1296, Alauddin Khalji 1296-1316 - TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 1320-1414 : Ghiyasuddin Tughluq 1320-1324, Muhammad Tughluq 1324-1351, Firuz Shah Tughluq 1351-1388 - SAYYID DYNASTY 1414-1451 : Khizr Khan 1414-1421 - LODI DYNASTY 1451-1526 : Bahlul Lodi 1451-1489 \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the historical progression of Delhi becoming a significant capital city, including its early rulers, its commercial importance, and the subsequent dynasties that constituted the Delhi Sultanate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that Delhi became an important city in the twelfth century.

Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIn other regions, regional cultures grew around religious traditions. The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What was the structure and content of Abul Fazl's Akbar Nama, and how did Akbar's religious discussions in the ibadat khana influence his philosophy of governance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about two main aspects: the Akbar Nama and the influence of ibadat khana discussions on Akbar's governance philosophy. \n\n1.  **Akbar Nama Structure and Content:** The text states, \"Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama.\" It specifies: \"The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign.\" For the third volume, it mentions: \"The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari.

This realization inspired his concept of 'sulh-i kul' or 'universal peace,' a philosophy of governance based on tolerance, non-discrimination between religions, and universally applicable ethics such as honesty, justice, and peace. Abul Fazl assisted Akbar in shaping this vision of governance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.4.8", "7.9.3", "8.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the key influences on Birsa Munda during his formative years, and how did these influences manifest in the goals and actions of his movement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text identifies several key influences on Birsa Munda. Firstly, as an adolescent, he \"heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt,\" speaking of a \"golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus\" and the need to \"win back their kingdom\" (Paragraph 2). Secondly, he attended a \"local missionary school\" where he learned it was possible for Mundas to \"attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights\" by becoming \"good Christians and gave up their 'bad practices'\" (Paragraph 3). Thirdly, he spent time with a \"prominent Vaishnav preacher,\" adopting the \"sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety\" (Paragraph 3). These influences manifested in his movement in distinct ways: \n\n1.  **From Munda Uprisings and Sirdars**: This directly fueled his political aim to \"recover their glorious past\" (Paragraph 5), establish a \"Munda Raj with Birsa at its head,\" and \"drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government\" (Paragraph 6). His followers acted on this by \"targeting the symbols of diku and European power,\" attacking \"police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars\" (Paragraph 8).\n2.  **From Missionaries and Vaishnav Preachers**: These influences led to the reformist aspect of his movement, as he \"urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery\" (Paragraph 4), reflecting the emphasis on 'good practices,' 'purity,' and 'piety.'\n\nHowever, while initially influenced by missionaries, Birsa also \"turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords,\" viewing them as \"outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life\" (Paragraph 4), thus incorporating their removal into his movement's broader political objectives.\n\nAnswer: Birsa Munda's formative years were influenced by tales of past Munda uprisings, the teachings from a missionary school, and a Vaishnav preacher. These influences shaped his movement's goals to recover a 'golden age' and establish a Munda Raj by expelling 'dikus' and Europeans, while also promoting social reforms among the Mundas such as abstaining from liquor and abandoning witchcraft, reflecting the values of purity and good practices. Paradoxically, he also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords, incorporating their removal as 'outside forces' into his movement's political aims."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.4.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

While this may suggest that this was an area that was inhabited only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. There were (and are) several groups who identify themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and central India. And of course, there are several peoples other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan. \nThese cultural traditions were closely linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. From about the eighth century, most of the present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) was one such ruler. These rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow their example. Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories \u2013 which often depicted dramatic situations, and a range of strong emotions \u2013 loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger, etc. \nDid women find a place within these stories? Sometimes, they figure as the \u201ccause\u201d for conflicts, as men fought with one another to either \u201cwin\u201d or \u201cprotect\u201d women. Women are also depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death \u2013 there are stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay for it with their lives. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBose and the INA \n A radical nationalist, with socialist leanings, Bose did not share Gandhiji\u2019s ideal of ahimsa, though he respected him as the \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d. In January 1941, he secretly left his Calcutta home, went to Singapore, via Germany, and raised the Azad Hind Fauj or the Indian National Army (INA). To free India from British control, in 1944, the INA tried to enter India through Imphal and Kohima but the campaign failed. The INA members were imprisoned and tried. People across the country, from all walks of life, participated in the movement against the INA trials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFrom the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people. The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain. As the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \u201cThey are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others.\u201d \nThe Vaishnava poet-saints of Maharashtra such as Jnaneshwar, Namadeva, Eknath and Tukaram were devotees of lord Vitthala. Devotion around lord Vitthala gave rise to the Varkari sect which lay emphasis on an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur. The cult of Vitthala emerged as a powerful mode of devotion and was very popular amongst the people. \nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant Tukaram: He who identifies with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart He treats A slave As his own son Says Tuka I won\u2019t be tired to repeat again Such a man Is God In person. Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela\u2019s son: You made us low caste, Why don\u2019t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life \u2013 left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this. You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha\u2019s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the key ways in which the saint-poets of Maharashtra challenged established social norms and religious practices, and what central humanist idea did they introduce concerning devotion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that the saint-poets of Maharashtra 'rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth.'

If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTake a look at Table 1 once again. You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains. But it was difficult to keep this balance all the time. Look at Table 1 again \u2013 note that Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji when he came to accept Mughal authority. What was the consequence of this insult? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nDid you notice the title of this book, Our Pasts? We have used the word \u2018pasts\u2019 in plural to draw attention to the fact that the past was different for different groups of people. For example, the lives of herders or farmers were different from those of kings and queens, the lives of merchants were different from those of crafts persons, and so on. Also, as is true even today, people followed different practices and customs in different parts  of the country. For example, today most people living in the Andaman Islands get their own food by fishing, hunting, and collecting forest produce. By contrast, most people living in cities depend on others for supplies of food. Differences such as these existed in the past as well. \nBesides, there is another kind of difference. We know a great deal about kings and the battles they fought because they kept records of their victories. Generally, ordinary people such as hunters, fishing folk, gatherers, farmers or herders did not keep records of what they did. While archaeology helps us to find out about their lives, there is much that remains unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Indian National Congress evolve in its objectives, methods, and internal dynamics from its establishment in 1885 through the period of the Swadeshi movement and subsequent split?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The Indian National Congress was established in December 1885.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives.

They also needed to identify edible plants and know the seasons for fruit ripening, as many plants could be poisonous. The third text section describes that traces of ash were found in Kurnool caves, suggesting familiarity with fire. It states fire could be used 'to roast meat' and 'to scare away animals.' Therefore, fire directly addresses the challenge of consuming hunted animals by making meat edible through roasting, and it could provide a means of defense or deterrence against dangerous animals. As a 'source of light,' fire could also assist in navigating or living in dark environments, indirectly helping with survival.\n\nAnswer: Hunter-gatherers faced challenges such as hunting animals faster and stronger than them, and identifying edible plants and their seasons. The use of fire could have helped by allowing them to roast meat, making it consumable, and by scaring away animals, offering protection.

The Vikram Samvat has also been adopted alongside the Gregorian calendar as the national calendar by independent India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, European countries were searching for spices and textiles, which had become popular both in Europe and West Asia. The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today. Crafts and commerce underwent major changes as merchants and artisans (such as weavers) were moved into the Black Towns established by the European companies within these new cities. The \u201cblacks\u201d or native traders and craftspersons were confined here while the \u201cwhite\u201d rulers occupied the superior residencies of Fort St. George in Madras or Fort St. William in Calcutta. The story of crafts and commerce in the eighteenth century will be taken up next year. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms.

An example is Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, who overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed the 'hiranya-garbha' ritual to establish his new status. Additionally, men from enterprising families, such as the Brahmanas Kadamba Mayurasharman and Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra, used military skills to establish their own kingdoms. In the northern villages, the 'grama bhojaka' held significant hereditary power, acting as the largest landowner, tax collector, judge, and policeman, as detailed in the second text. \n2. **Shifting Power/Loss of Autonomy (Later Period):** The fourth text illustrates a different kind of power shift with the advent of European companies in the 16th and 17th centuries. Initially, powerful Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora competed with the Europeans. However, European Companies used their naval power to gain control of sea trade, compelling Indian traders to work as their agents, thereby losing their commercial autonomy. Indian craftspersons, particularly weavers, also experienced a decline in independence.

Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the main contents of the three volumes of the Akbar Nama, including specific details about the Ain-i Akbari, and how did Abul Fazl contribute to framing Akbar's vision of governance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that Abul Fazl wrote the 'Akbar Nama' in three volumes.

At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThese stone boulders are known as megaliths (literally big stones). These were carefully arranged by people, and were used to mark burial sites. The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. \nSome important megalithic sites are shown on Map 2 (page14). While some megaliths can be seen on the surface, other megalithic burials are often underground. \nSometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground. These are the only indications that there are burials beneath. \nThere were several things that people did to make megaliths. We have made a list here. Try and arrange them in the correct order: digging pits in the earth, transporting stones, breaking boulders, placing stones in position, finding suitable stone, shaping stones, burying the dead. \nAll these burials have some common features. Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. Also found are tools and weapons of iron and sometimes, skeletons of horses, horse equipment and ornaments of stone and gold. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere are several things we can find out \u2014 what people ate, the kinds of clothes they wore, the houses in which they lived. We can find out about the lives of hunters, herders, farmers, rulers, merchants, priests, crafts persons, artists, musicians, and scientists. We can also find out about the games children played, the stories they heard, the plays they saw, the songs they sang. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nYou read about the Northern Black Polished Ware in Chapter 9. This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these long journeys. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nArchaeologists think that objects found with a skeleton probably belonged to the dead person. Sometimes, more objects are found in one grave than in another. Find Brahmagiri on Map 2 (page 14). Here, one skeleton was buried with 33 gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and one conch shell. Other skeletons have only a few pots. These finds suggest that there was some difference in status amongst the people who were buried. Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How do archaeological findings, including those from burial sites and evidence of trade, help historians understand social stratification and economic interactions in ancient India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Social Stratification from Burial Sites:** The text explains that archaeologists infer differences in status among the buried based on the objects found with skeletons. For example, at Brahmagiri, one skeleton was buried with numerous valuable items like 33 gold beads, 4 copper bangles, and a conch shell, while others had only a few pots. This disparity suggests some individuals were rich or chiefs, and others were poor or followers. The section on Megaliths further supports this, noting that these burial sites often contained distinctive pots (Black and Red Ware), iron tools and weapons, and sometimes ornaments of stone and gold, implying varying levels of wealth or status associated with the deceased. \n2. **Economic Interactions through Trade:** The text details extensive trade activities. The widespread discovery of 'Northern Black Polished Ware' indicates goods were carried by traders across the subcontinent. More significantly, the finding of 'many Roman gold coins in south India' provides strong archaeological evidence of robust economic interactions and trade between South India and the Roman Empire. South India was a source of valuable commodities like gold, spices (especially pepper, known as 'black gold' in the Roman Empire), and precious stones, which were transported by traders using ships across the sea and land caravans. The use of monsoon winds by sailors for quicker sea travel further illustrates the sophisticated nature of these trade networks.\n3. **Synthesis:** The presence of valuable goods like gold in burials (both at Brahmagiri and megalithic sites) can be linked to the wealth generated through trade, such as the exchange of pepper for Roman gold coins. Thus, archaeological finds from burials directly reflect social stratification, while the discovery of trade goods and foreign currency illustrates the economic interactions that likely contributed to such wealth disparities.\n\nAnswer: Archaeological findings from burial sites, such as the varying number and type of objects found with skeletons (e.g., gold beads and copper bangles versus a few pots at Brahmagiri, or gold ornaments and iron tools in megaliths), directly indicate social stratification and differences in status among ancient people. Evidence of trade, like the widespread Northern Black Polished Ware and the numerous Roman gold coins found in South India, reveals extensive economic interactions, particularly the export of gold, pepper, and precious stones from South India to the Roman Empire via sea and land routes, highlighting the wealth generated and circulated through these networks."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.1", "6.1.1", "7.1.4", "6.5.7", "6.5.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This is one of the oldest cities in Europe, and developed around the same time as the cities in the Ganga valley. Rome was the capital of one of the largest empires \u2014 one that spread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Augustus, one of the most important emperors, who ruled about 2000 years ago, said that he found Rome a city of brick, and made it into a city of marble. He, and later rulers, built temples and palaces. \nThey also built huge amphitheatres \u2014 open arenas surrounded by tiers of seats \u2014 where citizens could watch all kinds of shows, and public baths (with separate timings for men and women), where people met and relaxed.

Rana Pratap ascended the throne at Mewar in 1572, with Udaipur and large part of Mewar under his control. A series of envoys were sent to the Rana to persuade him to accept Mughal suzerainty, but he stood his ground. \nMany Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional politics at the Mughal court. \nThese influential Rajput families claimed the subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa. Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial territories neighbouring their watans. Nagaur was conquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, while Amber seized large portions of Bundi. Sawai Raja Jai Singh founded his new capital at Jaipur and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe pressure on these principalities and checked their further expansion. \nMany Rajput chieftains built a number of forts on hill tops which became centres of power.

His sway extended from Delhi to the banks of the Narmada. \nSawai Jai Singh, the ruler of Amber constructed five astronomical observatories, one each in Delhi, Jaipur, Ujjain, Mathura and Varanasi.

Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country. \nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of Odisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and 1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no inclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Odisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817. \nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures. It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of shortterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case of natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal. \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these grievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of making salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape. \nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took away a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions with Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started. The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The priests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support. \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha. Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi jagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed, many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by May 1817 the uprising was mostly contained. \nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May 1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and forbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary reforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \n In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had far reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To merely call it a \u2018Paik Rebellion\u2019 will thus be an understatement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary economic and administrative grievances that fueled the Khurda Uprising of 1817, and who was the key leader who emerged to spearhead the rebellion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text identifies several grievances leading to the Khurda Uprising. Firstly, the 'unfair settlement' following the deposition of King Mukunda Dev II and annexation of his territories by the British in 1803, which led to 'oppressive foreign rule'.

Further grievances included the introduction of the sicca rupee and insistence on revenue payment in this new currency, an 'unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt' due to a salt monopoly, and the auction of local estates in Calcutta to absentee landlords. The 'insensitive and corrupt police system' also worsened the situation.

In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development. There was a broad agreement on what was called a \u201cmixed economy\u201d model. Here, both the State and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs.

In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the evolution of British educational policy in India from the late 18th century through the mid-19th century, highlighting the different philosophies and their key proponents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes a significant evolution in British educational policy in India. Initially, the 'tradition of Orientalism' emerged, championed by individuals like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, and Nathaniel Halhed (as stated in the section 'The tradition of Orientalism'). These Orientalists held 'a deep respect for ancient cultures' and believed that 'Indians ought to be taught what they were already familiar with' to win their respect. This led to the establishment of institutions like the 'madrasa... in Calcutta in 1781' and the 'Hindu College... in Benaras in 1791' to promote the study of Arabic, Persian, Islamic law, and ancient Sanskrit texts.\n\nHowever, from the early nineteenth century, this vision faced criticism. Figures like James Mill argued that 'the aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical' and that Indians should be exposed to 'scientific and technical advances that the West had made'. The criticism sharpened by the 1830s with Thomas Babington Macaulay, who 'saw India as an uncivilised country' and declared 'a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia'. Macaulay strongly advocated for teaching the 'English language' to 'civilise people, changing their tastes, values and culture'. This led to the 'English Education Act of 1835', which made 'English the medium of instruction for higher education' and ceased the promotion of Oriental institutions.\n\nLater, 'in 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company' issued 'Wood\u2019s Despatch', which 'emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge'. This despatch highlighted 'economic' benefits, suggesting European learning would 'create a demand for British goods'. This led to the establishment of 'education departments' and 'a system of university education' in cities like Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay by 1857.\n\nFinally, the text also mentions the 'demand for moral education' by Christian missionaries, who believed 'morality could be improved only through Christian education', though the East India Company and later the British government were often reluctant to directly support these activities due to fears of 'enrag[ing] \u201cnative\u201d opinion'.\n\nAnswer: British educational policy in India evolved from an initial phase of Orientalism, which respected ancient Indian cultures and promoted the study of Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian through institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa (1781) and Hindu College (1791), championed by figures like William Jones and Henry Thomas Colebrooke. This approach aimed to win over the 'natives' and understand Indian heritage. However, by the early 19th century, critics like James Mill and later Thomas Babington Macaulay attacked Orientalism as impractical and inferior. Macaulay, in particular, advocated for English education to 'civilise' Indians and expose them to Western science and philosophy, leading to the English Education Act of 1835, which made English the medium of instruction for higher education. This shift was further solidified by Wood's Despatch in 1854, which emphasized the practical and economic benefits of European learning, including creating demand for British goods, and led to the establishment of universities in 1857. Christian missionaries also advocated for moral education through Christianity, though their efforts faced governmental reluctance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.7.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nEmperors need more resources than kings because empires are larger than kingdoms, and need to be protected by big armies. So also they need a larger number of officials who collect taxes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs the empire expanded to encompass different regions the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles (Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups. Those who joined Mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars. \nThe term mansabdar refers to an individual who holds a mansab, meaning a position or rank. It was a grading system used by the Mughals to fix (1) rank, (2) salary and (3) military responsibilities. Rank and salary were determined by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the noble\u2019s position in court and the larger his salary. \nNobles with a zat of 5,000 were ranked higher than those of 1,000. In Akbar\u2019s reign there were 29 mansabdars with a rank of 5,000 zat; by Aurangzeb\u2019s reign the number of mansabdars had increased to 79. \nThe mansabdar\u2019s military responsibilities required him to maintain a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary. \nMansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs which were somewhat like iqtas. But unlike muqtis, most mansabdars did not actually reside in or administer their jagirs. They only had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country. \nIn Akbar\u2019s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb\u2019s reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. These and other factors created a shortage in the number of jagirs. As a result, many jagirdars tried to extract as much revenue as possible while they had a jagir. Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore suffered tremendously. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the Mughal mansabdari system function to administer the expanding empire and its military, and what challenges did it face by Aurangzeb's reign?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explains that empires need large armies for protection and numerous officials to collect taxes due to their size. The third text section details how the Mughal mansabdari system addressed these needs. As the empire expanded, the Mughals recruited diverse people as mansabdars. This system fixed their rank, salary, and military responsibilities. Mansabdars were required to maintain a specified number of cavalrymen ('sawar'), directly contributing to the empire's military strength. For their salary, they received revenue assignments called 'jagirs,' with servants collecting the revenue, thus fulfilling an administrative role in resource management.\n\nHowever, by Aurangzeb's reign, several problems emerged. The actual revenue collected from jagirs often fell short of the granted sum. There was also a significant increase in the number of mansabdars, leading to a shortage of jagirs and long waiting periods for assignments. These issues caused many jagirdars to extract as much revenue as possible while they held a jagir, leading to tremendous suffering for the peasantry, a situation Aurangzeb was unable to control in his later years.\n\nAnswer: The Mughal mansabdari system served as a grading system to fix the rank, salary, and military responsibilities of its diverse recruits.

One is to search for and read books that were written long ago. These are called manuscripts, because they were written by hand (this comes from the Latin word \u2018manu\u2019, meaning hand). These were usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which grows in the Himalayas. \nOver the years, many manuscripts were eaten away by insects, some were destroyed, but many have survived, often preserved in temples and monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used by ordinary people) and Tamil. \nWe can also study inscriptions. These are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so that people could see, read and obey them.

For example, kings often kept records of victories in battle. \nCan you think of the advantages of writing on a hard surface? And what could have been the difficulties?

Bengal is a riverine plain which produces plenty of rice and fish. Understandably, these two items figure prominently in the menu of even poor Bengalis. Fishing has always been an important occupation and Bengali literature contains several references to fish. What is more, terracotta plaques on the walls of temples and viharas (Buddhist monasteries) depict scenes of fish being dressed and taken to the market in baskets. \nBrahmanas were not allowed to eat nonvegetarian food, but the popularity of fish in the local diet made the Brahmanical authorities relax this prohibition for the Bengal Brahmanas.

Many societies in the subcontinent did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. Nor were they divided into numerous unequal classes.

These were Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. All three states were founded by members of the high Mughal nobility who had been governors of large provinces \u2013 Sa\u2018adat Khan (Awadh), Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad). All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both Asaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Sa\u2018adat Khan\u2019s zat was 6,000. \nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state (1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had already gained control over its political and financial administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the actual ruler of that region. \nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. \nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2). \nA description of the Nizam of Hyderabad\u2019s personal troopers in 1790: \u2026The Nizam has a swaree (sawari) of 400 elephants, several thousand of horsemen near his person who receive upwards 100 R(upees)s nominal pay (and) are extremely well mounted and richly caparisoned \nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire. Awadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. In other words, he was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh. \nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawab\u2019s court. He seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand. \nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past. \nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Like the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars. \nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenthcentury Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars. The close connection between the state and bankers \u2013 noticeable in Hyderabad and Awadh as well \u2013 was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756). During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous. \nIf we take a bird\u2019s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states. First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably. The third common feature in all these regional states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the three most significant common features regarding the administrative and economic structure of the states of Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad as they emerged from Mughal control in the eighteenth century?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly lists three common features shared by Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad in the concluding paragraph. \n1.  **Suspicion of inherited administrative systems:** The text states, \"First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system.\" This is supported by actions like Awadh's reduction of Mughal-appointed jagirdars and Bengal's transfer of Mughal jagirdars to Orissa. \n2.  **Reliance on revenue-farmers (ijaradars) for tax collection:** The text indicates, \"Second, their method of tax collection differed.

The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe last and 24th tirthankara of the Jainas, Vardhamana Mahavira, also spread his message around this time, i.e. 2500 years ago. He was a kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha, about which you read in Chapter 6. At the age of thirty, he left home and went to live in a forest. For twelve years he led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment. \nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes. They must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings. \u201cAll beings,\u201d said Mahavira \u201clong to live. To all things life is dear.\u201d Ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers, because they used Prakrit. There were several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of the country, and named after the regions in which they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken in Magadha was known as Magadhi. \nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and were especially asked not to steal. Also, they had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up everything, including their clothes. \nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands left their homes to learn and teach this new way of life. Many more remained behind and supported those who became monks and nuns, providing them with food. \nJainism was supported mainly by traders. Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and his followers were transmitted orally for several centuries. They were written down in the form in which they are presently available at a place called Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see Map 7, page 113). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n2 From Trade to Territory \n The Company Establishes Power \n\n Aurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He established control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707, many Mughal governors (subadars) and big zamindars began asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India, Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre. \nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, however, a new power was emerging on the political horizon \u2013 the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories? How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire? In this chapter you will see how this came about. \nAfter Aurangzeb there was no powerful Mughal ruler, but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact, when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Mughal emperor at the time, was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company, Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom, and his sons were shot in cold blood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nOne of the commonest ways of describing people is in terms of the language they speak. When we refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take these identities for granted and assume that they have existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers separating regions have evolved over time (and in fact are still changing). Also, what we understand as regional cultures today are often the product of complex processes of intermixing of local traditions with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As we will see, some traditions appear specific to some regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and yet others derive from older practices in a particular area, but take a new form in other regions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, why did the English East India Company attempt to gain control over the Jagannatha temple at Puri, and what was their broader political status in India around that time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section explicitly states the reason for the English East India Company's attempt to control the Jagannatha temple: 'They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people.'

These indicate that people, perhaps belonging to the same family, were buried in the same place though not at the same time. The bodies of those who died later were brought into the grave through the portholes. Stone circles or boulders placed on the surface probably served as signposts to find the burial site, so that people could return to the same place whenever they wanted to. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, days or years \u2013 as a clock or a calendar. Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFallow \u2013 A field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility. Sal \u2013 A tree. Mahua \u2013 A flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol. Bewar \u2013 A term used in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation. \nHow Did Tribal Groups Live? \n\n By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities. Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nOrdinary people also told stories, composed poems and songs, sang, danced, and performed plays. Some of these are preserved in collections of stories such as the Jatakas and the Panchatantra, which were written down around this time.

Let\u2019s travel in our imagination to Thanjavur, the capital of the Cholas, as it was a thousand years ago. The perennial river Kaveri flows near this beautiful town. One hears the bells of the Rajarajeshvara temple built by King Rajaraja Chola. The towns people are all praise for its architect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan who has proudly carved his name on the temple wall. Inside is a massive Shiva linga. \nBesides the temple, there are palaces with mandapas or pavilions. Kings hold court in these mandapas, issuing orders to their subordinates. There are also barracks for the army. \nThe town is bustling with markets selling grain, spices, cloth and jewellery. Water supply for the town comes from wells and tanks. The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses.

Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, how did the nature of political authority and the forms of social participation in significant events differ between the 'medieval' period, as exemplified by the Chola capital Thanjavur, and the 'modern' period of Indian nationalism?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first identify descriptions of political authority and social participation in the 'medieval' period from the relevant text sections, specifically the one detailing Thanjavur. Then, I will do the same for the 'modern' period by analyzing the sections on Indian nationalism and revolutionary activities. Finally, I will synthesize these observations to highlight the differences.\n\n1.  **Medieval Period (Chola Capital Thanjavur):** The text describes political authority as being indigenous and monarchical, centered around King Rajaraja Chola. The king built temples, held court in mandapas, and issued orders to subordinates, indicating a centralized and hierarchical system of governance. Social participation in significant historical events is not explicitly detailed as active resistance or mass movements; rather, the text focuses on the specialized roles of townspeople like weavers and sculptors, and the general prosperity of the kingdom, which attracted European trading companies (linking back to the first section's general description of the medieval period).\n\n2.  **Modern Period (Indian Nationalism):** The text presents political authority as the British colonial rule, characterized by exploitation and tyranny (e.g., increased taxes, curbed fundamental rights like freedom of expression through the Rowlatt Act, brutal suppression like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre). Social participation in significant events, primarily the struggle against this colonial authority, is depicted as widespread and diverse. It evolved into a 'mass movement' involving peasants, tribals, students, women, factory workers, and business groups. Forms of participation included non-violent movements (Satyagraha, hartals, boycotts of foreign goods and institutions, picketing) led by Mahatma Gandhi, as well as revolutionary violence by groups like the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) involving assassinations and bomb throws. People also linked their movements to local grievances, interpreting leaders' calls in their own ways, and aimed for 'Purna Swaraj' (complete independence).\n\n3.  **Difference:** The 'medieval' period, as shown by Thanjavur, featured an indigenous, monarchical political authority with a structured society whose participation in political change is not highlighted in the text. In contrast, the 'modern' period saw an alien, colonial political authority being actively and widely challenged by diverse segments of Indian society through a range of organized mass movements and revolutionary actions, all driven by a desire for self-rule and freedom from colonial exploitation and injustice.\n\nAnswer: In the 'medieval' period, exemplified by the Chola capital Thanjavur, political authority was indigenous and monarchical, centered around a king who administered the kingdom and patronized religious and economic activities. Social participation in political change, as described, was not characterized by widespread active movements. Conversely, in the 'modern' period of Indian nationalism, political authority was the British colonial rule, which was actively and widely resisted. Social participation involved diverse groups like peasants, tribals, students, women, and workers engaging in both non-violent mass movements (e.g., Satyagraha, boycotts, picketing) and revolutionary actions (e.g., assassinations, bombings) to challenge colonial exploitation and achieve self-rule."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.1.7", "7.6.2", "8.9.3", "8.9.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

But social change was not the same everywhere, because different kinds of societies evolved differently. It is important to understand how, and why, this happened. \nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms. The difference between the high and low, and between the rich and poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, how was society structured in large parts of the subcontinent, and what factors influenced the development of its social hierarchy over time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that in 'large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna.'

Rather than appointing aristocrats and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special slaves purchased for military service, called bandagan in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some of the most important political offices in the kingdom. Since they were totally dependent upon their master, the Sultan could trust and rely upon them. \nThe Sultans were advised: A slave, whom one has brought up and promoted, must be looked after for it needs a whole lifetime and good luck to find a worthy and experienced slave. Wise men have said that a worthy and experienced slave is better than a son \nThe Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often their clients, to high political positions. They were appointed as generals and governors. However, this also introduced an element of political instability. Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to their heirs. New Sultans had their own servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility. The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices. \nOfficials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq : Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, a midfourteenth- century chronicler, reported their appointments as a sign of the Sultan\u2019s loss of political judgement and his incapacity to rule. \nLike the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands were called iqta and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti. The duty of the muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas. In exchange for their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary. They also paid their soldiers from these revenues. Control over muqtis was most effective if their office was not inheritable and if they were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being shifted. These harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by the muqtis. Care was taken that the muqti collected only the taxes prescribed by the state and that he kept the required number of soldiers. \nAs the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the landed chieftains \u2013 the samanta aristocrats \u2013 and rich landlords to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control. The rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan\u2019s administrators measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors. There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses. \nIt is important to remember that large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultans. It was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after annexing southern India, the entire region became independent. Even in the Gangetic plain there were forested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate. Local chieftains established their rule in these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in these areas but only for a short duration. \nIbn Battuta, a fourteenth-century traveller from Morocco, Africa, explained that chieftains sometimes fortified themselves in mountains, in rocky, uneven and rugged places as well as in bamboo groves. In India the bamboo is not hollow; it is big. Its several parts are so intertwined that even fire cannot affect them, and they are on the whole very strong. The chieftains live in these forests which serve them as ramparts, inside which are their cattle and their crops. There is also water for them within, that is, rain water which collects there. Hence they cannot be subdued except by powerful armies, who entering these forests, cut down the bamboos with specially prepared instruments. \nThe Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule. This forced the two rulers to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge. Let us see how the two Sultans dealt with this. Alauddin Khalji : Alauddin constructed a new garrison town named Siri for his soldiers. See Map 1. The soldiers had to be fed. This was done through the produce collected as tax from lands between the Ganga and Yamuna. Tax was fixed at 50 per cent of the peasant\u2019s yield. The soldiers had to be paid. Alauddin chose to pay his soldiers salaries in cash rather than iqtas. The soldiers would buy their supplies from merchants in Delhi and it was thus feared that merchants would raise their prices. To stop this, Alauddin controlled the prices of goods in Delhi. Prices were carefully surveyed by officers, and merchants who did not sell at the prescribed rates were punished. Alauddin\u2019s administrative measures were quite successful and chroniclers praised his reign for its cheap prices and efficient supplies of goods in the market. He successfully withstood the threat of Mongol invasions. Muhammad Tughluq : The Sultanate was attacked in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign. The Mongol army was defeated. Muhammad Tughluq was confident about the strength of his army and his resources to plan an attack on Transoxiana. He therefore raised a large standing army. Rather than constructing a new garrison town, the oldest of the four cities of Delhi (Dehli-i Kuhna) was emptied of its residents and the soldiers garrisoned there. The residents of the old city were sent to the new capital of Daulatabad in the south. Produce from the same area was collected as tax to feed the army. But to meet the expense of maintaining such a large number of soldiers the Sultan levied additional taxes. This coincided with famine in the area. Muhammad Tughluq also paid his soldiers cash salaries. But instead of controlling prices, he used a \u201ctoken\u201d currency, somewhat like present-day paper currency, but made out of cheap metals, not gold and silver. People in the fourteenth century did not trust these coins. They were very smart: they saved their gold and silver coins and paid all their taxes to the state with this token currency. This cheap currency could also be counterfeited easily. Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s administrative measures were a failure. His campaign into Kashmir was a disaster. He then gave up his plans to invade Transoxiana and disbanded his large army. Meanwhile, his administrative measures created complications. The shifting of people to Daulatabad was resented. The raising of taxes and famine in the Ganga-Yamuna belt led to widespread rebellion. And finally, the \u201ctoken\u201d currency had to be recalled. \nIn this list of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s failures we sometimes forget that for the first time in the history of the Sultanate, a Delhi Sultan planned a campaign to capture Mongol territory. Unlike Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures, Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were conceived as a part of a military offensive against the Mongols. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWorking Towards Change \n\n From the early nineteenth century, we find debates and discussions about social customs and practices taking on a new character. One important reason for this was the development of new forms of communication. For the first time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and pamphlets were printed. These were far cheaper and far more accessible than the manuscripts that you have read about in Class VII. Therefore ordinary people could read these, and many of them could also write and express their ideas in their own languages. All kinds of issues \u2013 social, political, economic and religious \u2013 could now be debated and discussed by men (and sometimes by women as well) in the new cities. The discussions could reach out to a wider public, and could become linked to movements for social change. \nThese debates were often initiated by Indian reformers and reform groups. One such reformer was Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833). He founded a reform association known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known as the Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. People such as Rammohun Roy are described as reformers because they felt that changes were necessary in society, and unjust practices needed to be done away with. They thought that the best way to ensure such changes was by persuading people to give up old practices and adopt a new way of life. \nRammohun Roy was keen to spread the knowledge of Western education in the country and bring about greater freedom and equality for women. He wrote about the way women were forced to bear the burden of domestic work, confined to the home and the kitchen, and not allowed to move out and become educated. \nChanging the lives of widows \n Rammohun Roy was particularly moved by the problems widows faced in their lives. He began a campaign against the practice of sati. Rammohun Roy was well versed in Sanskrit, Persian and several other Indian and Europeon languages. He tried to show through his writings that the practice of widow burning had no sanction in ancient texts. By the early nineteenth century, many British officials had also begun to criticise Indian traditions and customs. They were therefore more than willing to listen to Rammohun who was reputed to be a learned man. In 1829, sati was banned. \nThe strategy adopted by Rammohun was used by later reformers as well. Whenever they wished to challenge a practice that seemed harmful, they tried to find a verse or sentence in the ancient sacred texts that supported their point of view. They then suggested that the practice as it existed at present was against early tradition. \nFor instance, one of the most famous reformers, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, used the ancient texts to suggest that widows could remarry. His suggestion was adopted by British officials, and a law was passed in 1856 permitting widow remarriage. Those who were against the remarriage of widows opposed Vidyasagar, and even boycotted him. \nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, the movement in favour of widow remarriage spread to other parts of the country. In the Telugu-speaking areas of the Madras Presidency, Veerasalingam Pantulu formed an association for widow remarriage. Around the same time young intellectuals and reformers in Bombay pledged themselves to working for the same cause. In the north, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who founded the reform association called Arya Samaj, also supported widow remarriage. Yet, the number of widows who actually remarried remained low. Those who married were not easily accepted in society and conservative groups continued to oppose the new law. \nGirls begin going to school \n Many of the reformers felt that education for girls was necessary in order to improve the condition of women. Vidyasagar in Calcutta and many other reformers in Bombay set up schools for girls. When the first schools were opened in the mid-nineteenth century, many people were afraid of them. They feared that schools would take girls away from home, prevent them from doing their domestic duties. Moreover, girls had to travel through public places in order to reach school. Many people felt that this would have a corrupting influence on them. They felt that girls should stay away from public spaces. Therefore, throughout the nineteenth century, most educated women were taught at home by liberal fathers or husbands. Sometimes women taught themselves. Do you remember what you read about Rashsundari Debi in your book Social and Political Life last year? She was one of those who secretly learned to read and write in the flickering light of candles at night. \nIn the latter part of the century, schools for girls were established by the Arya Samaj in Punjab, and Jyotirao Phule in Maharashtra. In aristocratic Muslim households in North India, women learnt to read the Koran in Arabic. They were taught by women who came home to teach. Some reformers such as Mumtaz Ali reinterpreted verses from the Koran to argue for women\u2019s education. The first Urdu novels began to be written from the late nineteenth century. Amongst other things, these were meant to encourage women to read about religion and domestic management in a language they could understand. \nWomen write about women From the early twentieth century, Muslim women like the Begums of Bhopal played a notable role in promoting education among women. They founded a primary school for girls at Aligarh. Another remarkable woman, Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain started schools for Muslim girls in Patna and Calcutta. She was a fearless critic of conservative ideas, arguing that religious leaders of every faith accorded an inferior place to women. \nBy the 1880s, Indian women began to enter universities. Some of them trained to be doctors, some became teachers. Many women began to write and publish their critical views on the place of women in society. Tarabai Shinde, a woman educated at home at Poona, published a book, Stripurushtulna, (A Comparison between Women and Men), criticising the social differences between men and women. \nPandita Ramabai, a great scholar of Sanskrit, felt that Hinduism was oppressive towards women, and wrote a book about the miserable lives of upper-caste Hindu women. She founded a widows\u2019 home at Poona to provide shelter to widows who had been treated badly by their husbands\u2019 relatives. Here women were trained so that they could support themselves economically. \nNeedless to say, all this more than alarmed the orthodox. For instance, many Hindu nationalists felt that Hindu women were adopting Western ways and that this would corrupt Hindu culture and erode family values. Orthodox Muslims were also worried about the impact of these changes. \nAs you can see, by the end of the nineteenth century, women themselves were actively working for reform. They wrote books, edited magazines, founded schools and training centres, and set up women\u2019s associations. From the early twentieth century, they formed political pressure groups to push through laws for female suffrage (the right to vote) and better health care and education for women. Some of them joined various kinds of nationalist and socialist movements from the 1920s. \nIn the twentieth century, leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose lent their support to demands for greater equality and freedom for women. Nationalist leaders promised that there would be full suffrage for all men and women after Independence. However, till then they asked women to concentrate on the anti-British struggles. \nLaw against child marriage \n With the growth of women\u2019s organisations and writings on these issues, the momentum for reform gained strength. People challenged another established custom \u2013 that of child marriage. There were a number of Indian legislators in the Central Legislative Assembly who fought to make a law preventing child marriage. In 1929 the Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed without the kind of bitter debates and struggles that earlier laws had seen. According to the Act no man below the age of 18 and woman below the age of 16 could marry. Subsequently these limits were raised to 21 for men and 18 for women. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n3 Ruling the Countryside \n\n The Company Becomes the Diwan \n On 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nMercantile \u2013 A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices \nEast India Company Comes East \n\n In 1800, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's primary mercantile objective influence its revenue administration in Bengal after becoming the Diwan, and what were the immediate economic consequences for the region?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify the Company's primary objective:** The text in 'East India Company Comes East' states that mercantile companies aim to 'make profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear.' It also notes that after the Battle of Plassey, the Company's 'prime objective was the expansion of trade.'\n2. **Identify the acquisition of Diwani:** The text in 'Ruling the Countryside' mentions that the East India Company was appointed as the Diwan of Bengal on August 12, 1765, making it the 'chief financial administrator' of the territory.\n3. **Connect objective to revenue administration:** 'Ruling the Countryside' explains that even as Diwan, the Company 'still saw itself primarily as a trader.' It 'wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection.' Instead, 'The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible.' Furthermore, the revenue collected in Bengal was used to 'finance the purchase of goods for export,' as detailed in 'Ruling the Countryside' and 'East India Company Comes East', removing the need to import gold and silver from Britain.\n4. **Detail the economic consequences:** 'Ruling the Countryside' describes that this approach led to a 'deep crisis' in the Bengal economy. 'Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices.' 'Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them.' Consequently, 'Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse.' This culminated in a 'terrible famine' in 1770, which 'killed ten million people in Bengal,' wiping out 'about one-third of the population.'\n\nAnswer: After becoming the Diwan of Bengal in 1765, the East India Company, driven by its primary mercantile objective to expand trade and buy goods cheaply, focused on maximizing revenue collection without establishing a regular system of assessment. This revenue was then used to finance its purchases of Indian goods for export, rather than importing gold and silver. The immediate economic consequences for Bengal were severe: artisans deserted villages due to forced low-price sales, peasants struggled to pay high dues, artisanal production declined, agricultural cultivation collapsed, and a terrible famine in 1770 killed approximately ten million people, or one-third of the population."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.8.2", "8.3.1", "7.3.4", "8.2.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

How did men become rulers in the past? Some of the rajas we read about in Chapter 5 were probably chosen by the jana, the people. But, around 3000 years ago, we find some changes taking place in the ways in which rajas were chosen. Some men now became recognised as rajas by performing very big sacrifices. \nThe ashvamedha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely and it was guarded by the raja\u2019s men. If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them. These rajas were then invited to the sacrifice, which was performed by specially trained priests, who were rewarded with gifts. The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him. \nThe raja was a central figure in these rituals. He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in the battle field and witnessed his exploits, chanted tales of his glory. His relatives, especially his wives and sons, had to perform a variety of minor rituals. The other rajas were simply spectators who had to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice. Priests performed the rituals including the sprinkling of sacred water on the king. The ordinary people, the vish or vaishya, also brought gifts. However, some people, such as those who were regarded as shudras by the priests, were excluded from many rituals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nYou may have heard about the Vedas. There are four of them \u2013 the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or \u201cwell-said\u201d. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. \nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis). Priests taught students to recite and memorise each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with great care. Most of the hymns were composed, taught and learnt by men. A few were composed by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. \nThe books we use are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What methods were used to establish a raja's power around 3000 years ago, and what new administrative strategies were later adopted by kings to maintain their authority and win support?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed.

They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that can be profitably sold in other places \u2026 In a tanda there may be as many as 6 or 7 hundred persons \u2026 They do not travel more than 6 or 7 miles a day \u2013 that, too, in the cool weather. After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them. \nMany pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. Different castes of petty pedlars also travelled from village to village. They made and sold wares such as ropes, reeds, straw matting and coarse sacks. Sometimes mendicants acted as wandering merchants. There were castes of entertainers who performed in different towns and villages for their livelihood. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIf you plant a seed, you will notice that it takes some time to grow. This may be for several days, weeks, months and in some cases years. When people began growing plants, it meant that they had to stay in the same place for a long time looking after the plants, watering, weeding, driving away animals and birds \u2014 till the grain ripened. And then, the grain had to be used carefully. \nAs grain had to be stored for both food and seed, people had to think of ways of storing it. In many areas, they began making large clay pots, or wove baskets, or dug pits into the ground. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory.

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries?

Their characteristics included traveling with their 'household \u2013 wives and children,' with a tanda consisting of 'many families' and potentially '6 or 7 hundred persons.' They owned their oxen and often acted as merchants themselves, buying goods 'where it is cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer,' then reloading with other profitable items. They typically traveled 'not more than 6 or 7 miles a day' in cool weather and allowed their oxen to graze freely.\n\nAnswer: The Banjaras were the most significant trader-nomads in India, operating in caravans called tandas. They played a vital role in trade and transport, primarily carrying grain such as wheat and rice across long distances, supplying city markets and even the Mughal army. Their operations were extensive, with accounts mentioning tandas comprising thousands of oxen and hundreds of people. The Banjaras owned their oxen and often functioned as merchants, buying goods cheaply in one location and selling them for profit where prices were higher. They traveled with their entire households, including wives and children, covering moderate distances daily and allowing their animals to graze freely after unloading."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.9.9", "8.6.1", "7.7.4", "6.12.7", "6.3.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century.

In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) than about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwara. \nBefore his death in 1539, Baba Guru Nanak appointed one of his followers as his successor. His name was Lehna but he came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that he was a part of Baba Guru Nanak himself. Guru Angad compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur\u2019s son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as \u2018a state within the state\u2019. The Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement. The ideas of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this development from the very beginning. He emphasised the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications. This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAbout 2000 years ago, Christianity emerged in West Asia. Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem, which was then part of the Roman empire. Christ\u2019s teachings were that He was the Saviour of the world. He also taught people to treat others with love and trust others, just as they themselves wanted to be treated. \nChrist\u2019s teachings appealed to ordinary people, and spread through West Asia, Africa and Europe. The first Christian preachers came from West Asia to the west coast of the subcontinent within a hundred years of Christ\u2019s death. \nThe Christians of Kerala, known as Syrian Christians because they probably came from West Asia, are amongst the oldest Christian communities in the world. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made. These developments took place simultaneously, i.e. at the same time. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of the book. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What was the approximate timeframe for the emergence of Christianity, and how did this compare to the collapse of the Mauryan empire and the establishment of the Satavahana kingdom?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities.

They were carved in stone, and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 7). \nAshoka was one of the greatest rulers known to history and on his instructions inscriptions were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock surfaces. Before we find out what was written in these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom was called an empire. \nThe empire that Ashoka ruled was founded by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was supported by a wise man named Chanakya or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya\u2019s ideas were written down in a book called the Arthashastra. \nThere were several cities in the empire (marked with black dots on the map). These included the capital Pataliputra, Taxila, and Ujjain. Taxila was a gateway to the northwest, including Central Asia, while Ujjain lay on the route from north to south India. Merchants, officials and crafts persons probably lived in these cities. \nIn other areas there were villages of farmers and herders. In some areas such as central India, there were forests where people gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food. People in different parts of the empire spoke different languages. They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore different kinds of clothes as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the descriptions of economic conditions and social stratification differ between the empire founded by Chandragupta Maurya and the Mughal Empire, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section describes the empire founded by Chandragupta Maurya. It mentions various groups like 'merchants, officials and crafts persons' living in cities, and 'farmers and herders' in villages, as well as people who 'gathered forest produce and hunted animals for food' in forests. It highlights that people spoke different languages, ate different foods, and wore different clothes, indicating a diverse society based on occupation and geography, but it does not explicitly detail economic inequality or stratification.\n\nThe second text section, concerning the Mughal Empire, explicitly states that 'international travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring.' It provides specific details, noting that a small number of 'highest-ranking mansabdars' (5.6% of the total) received '61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue.' It also distinguishes between 'the poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth' and 'The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited.'\n\nTherefore, the key difference is that the text describing Chandragupta Maurya's empire focuses on societal diversity in terms of occupations and lifestyles across regions, while the text describing the Mughal Empire explicitly details and quantifies severe economic inequality and social stratification.\n\nAnswer: The text describes the empire founded by Chandragupta Maurya as having a diverse society with various occupations and lifestyles across different regions (cities, villages, forests), but it does not explicitly mention economic inequality or stratification. In stark contrast, the text explicitly details the Mughal Empire's 'glaring inequalities,' where 'poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence,' citing that a small fraction of high-ranking mansabdars received a vast majority of the empire's revenue, leaving the poorest to live 'from hand to mouth.'"}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.8.1", "7.4.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

There are four of them \u2013 the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or \u201cwell-said\u201d. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. \nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis). Priests taught students to recite and memorise each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with great care. Most of the hymns were composed, taught and learnt by men. A few were composed by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. \nThe books we use are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAftermath The British had regained control of the country by the end of 1859, but they could not carry on ruling the land with the same policies any more. Given below are the important changes that were introduced by the British. \n1. The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of Indian affairs. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a council to advise him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. Through these measures the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India. \n2. All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as subordinates of the British Crown. \n3. It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4. The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British believed that they were responsible for the rebellion in a big way. \n 5. The British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India. \n 6.

Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, days or years \u2013 as a clock or a calendar. Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What prompted Rabindranath Tagore to renounce his knighthood, and what is the definition of knighthood according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text first defines 'Knighthood' as 'An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service.'

So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMost of Egypt is a dry desert, except for the lands along the river Nile \nAround 5000 years ago, kings ruled over Egypt. These kings sent armies to distant lands to get gold, silver, ivory, timber, and precious stones. They also built huge tombs, known as pyramids. \nWhen they died, the bodies of kings were preserved and buried in these pyramids. These carefully preserved bodies are known as \u2018mummies\u2019. A large number of objects were also buried with them. These included food and drink, clothes, ornaments, utensils, musical instruments, weapons and animals. Sometimes even serving men and women were buried with the rulers. These are amongst the most elaborate burials known in world history. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\n1 How, When and Where\n\nHow Important are Dates?\nThere was a time when historians were fascinated with dates. There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIn the nineteenth century, the region that constitutes most of present-day Rajasthan, was called Rajputana by the British. While this may suggest that this was an area that was inhabited only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. There were (and are) several groups who identify themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and central India. And of course, there are several peoples other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan. \nThese cultural traditions were closely linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. From about the eighth century, most of the present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) was one such ruler. These rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow their example. Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories \u2013 which often depicted dramatic situations, and a range of strong emotions \u2013 loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger, etc. \nDid women find a place within these stories? Sometimes, they figure as the \u201ccause\u201d for conflicts, as men fought with one another to either \u201cwin\u201d or \u201cprotect\u201d women. Women are also depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death \u2013 there are stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay for it with their lives. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what are the main criticisms against the different methods of periodizing Indian history?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text discusses two main methods of periodizing Indian history and their criticisms in the section 'How do we periodise?'.\n\nFirstly, regarding James Mill's three-volume work, 'A History of British India', which divided Indian history into Hindu, Muslim, and British periods, the text states several problems:\n1. Mill believed Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe, depicting pre-British India as ruled by 'Hindu and Muslim despots' characterized by 'religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices'.\n2. This periodization suggested that British rule was necessary to 'civilise India' and introduce 'European manners, arts, institutions and laws', implying India was 'not capable of progress without British help'.\n3. It's problematic to 'characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time', as it suggests 'the lives and practices of the others do not really matter' and ignores the 'variety of faiths exist simultaneously'.\n\nSecondly, regarding the division into 'ancient', 'medieval' and 'modern' periods, borrowed from the West, the text highlights a problem:\n1. In the West, the 'modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality'.\n2. Applying this uncritically to the period of British rule in India is problematic because 'under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress'.\n3. Consequently, many historians refer to this period as 'colonial' instead, to reflect the 'subjugation of one country by another' leading to political, economic, social and cultural changes.\n\nAnswer: The text criticizes James Mill's periodization (Hindu, Muslim, British) for assuming Asian societies were inferior, portraying pre-British India as dark and despotic, and suggesting British rule was essential for civilization and progress. It also finds fault with characterizing an era solely by the rulers' religion. Additionally, the text criticizes the Western-derived 'ancient', 'medieval', 'modern' periodization, arguing that applying 'modern' to British-ruled India is inaccurate because it lacked features like equality, freedom, and economic growth, leading many historians to prefer the term 'colonial' for that period."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.7.8", "7.9.7", "8.1.1", "7.9.4", "6.4.11"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country. \nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of Odisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and 1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no inclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Odisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817. \nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures. It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of shortterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case of natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal. \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these grievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of making salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape. \nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took away a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions with Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started. The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The priests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support. \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha. Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi jagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed, many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by May 1817 the uprising was mostly contained. \nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May 1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and forbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary reforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \n In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had far reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To merely call it a \u2018Paik Rebellion\u2019 will thus be an understatement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made. These developments took place simultaneously, i.e. at the same time. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of the book. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary factors that fueled the Khurda Uprising in 1817, according to the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the section 'The Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study' details multiple grievances that led to the uprising.

The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi.

Different plants grow in different conditions \u2014 rice, for example, requires more water than wheat and barley. This explains why farmers grow some crops in some areas and not in other areas. Different animals too, prefer different environments \u2014 for instance, sheep and goat can survive more easily than cattle in dry, hilly environments. But, as you saw in Chapter 2, women and men did not always produce their own food. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs the rulers of the mahajanapadas were (a) building huge forts (b) maintaining big armies, they needed more resources. And they needed officials to collect these. So, instead of depending on occasional gifts brought by people, as in the case of the raja of the janapadas, they started collecting regular taxes. \nTaxes on crops were the most important. This was because most people were farmers. Usually, the tax was fixed at 1/6th of what was produced. This was known as bhaga or a share. \nThere were taxes on crafts persons as well. These could have been in the form of labour. For example, a weaver or a smith may have had to work for a day every month for the king. \nHerders were also expected to pay taxes in the form of animals and animal produce. \nThere were also taxes on goods that were bought and sold, through trade. \nAnd hunters and gatherers also had to provide forest produce to the raja. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nFind Rome on Map 6 (page 84).

Qutbuddin Aybak had this constructed around 1199. Notice the pattern created under the balcony by the small arches and geometrical designs. Can you see two bands of inscriptions under the balcony? These are in Arabic. Notice that the surface of the minar is curved and angular. Placing an inscription on such a surface required great precision. Only the most skilled craftsperson could perform this task. Remember that very few buildings were made of stone or brick 800 years ago. What would have been the impact of a building like the Qutb Minar on observers in the thirteenth century? \nBetween the eighth and the eighteenth centuries kings and their officers built two kinds of structures: the first were forts, palaces, garden residences and tombs \u2013 safe, protected and grandiose places of rest in this world and the next; the second were structures meant for public activity including temples, mosques, tanks, wells, caravanserais and bazaars. Kings were expected to care for their subjects, and by making structures for their use and comfort, rulers hoped to win their praise. Construction activity was also carried out by others, including merchants. They built temples, mosques and wells. However, domestic architecture \u2013 large mansions (havelis) of merchants \u2013 has survived only from the eighteenth century. \nBuilt by Akbar, the Agra Fort required 2,000 stone-cutters, 2,000 cement and lime-makers and 8,000 labourers \nThe Qutb Minar is five storeys high. The band of inscriptions you see are under its first balcony. The first floor was constructed by Qutbuddin Aybak and the rest by Iltutmish around 1229. Over the years it was damaged by lightning and earthquakes and repaired by Alauddin Khalji, Muhammad Tughluq, Firuz Shah Tughluq and Ibrahim Lodi. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHindu The word \u2018Hindu\u2019, like the term \u2018India\u2019 is derived from the river Indus.

You will sometimes find AD before dates. This stands for two Latin words, Anno Domini, meaning in the year of the Lord (i.e. Christ). So 2012 can also be written as AD 2012. Sometimes CE is used instead of AD and BCE instead of BC. The letters CE stand for Common Era and BCE for Before Common Era. We use these terms because the Christian Era is now used in most countries of the world. In India we began using this form of dating from about two hundred years ago. And sometimes, the letters BP meaning Before Present are used. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle, children (especially sons), and horses. Horses were yoked to chariots that were used in battles, which were fought to capture cattle. Battles were also fought for land, which was important for pasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened quickly, such as barley. Some battles were fought for water, and to capture people. \nSome of the wealth that was obtained was kept by the leaders, some was given to the priests and the rest was distributed amongst the people. Some wealth was used for the performance of yajnas or sacrifices in which offerings were made into the fire. These were meant for gods and goddesses. Offerings could include ghee, grain, and in some cases, animals. \nMost men took part in these wars. There was no regular army, but there were assemblies where people met and discussed matters of war and peace. They also chose leaders, who were often brave and skilful warriors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the priests during the later Vedic period, which varnas were permitted to perform sacrifices, and which groups were restricted from studying the Vedas?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The relevant information is found in the section detailing the later Vedic period and the varna system.

Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations.

Firangis \u2013 Foreigners The term reflects an attitude of contempt. \nA Mutiny Becomes a Popular Rebellion \n\n Though struggles between rulers and the ruled are not unusual, sometimes such struggles become quite widespread as a popular resistance so that the power of the state breaks down. A very large number of people begin to believe that they have a common enemy and rise up against the enemy at the same time. For such a situation to develop people have to organise, communicate, take initiative and display the confidence to turn the situation around. \nSuch a situation developed in the northern parts of India in 1857. After a hundred years of conquest and administration, the English East India Company faced a massive rebellion that started in May 1857 and threatened the Company\u2019s very presence in India. Sepoys mutinied in several places beginning from Meerut and a large number of people from different sections of society rose up in rebellion. Some regard it as the biggest armed resistance to colonialism in the nineteenth century anywhere in the world. \nFrom Meerut to Delhi \n On 29 March 1857, a young soldier, Mangal Pandey, was hanged to death for attacking his officers in Barrackpore. Some days later, some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges, which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs. Eighty-five sepoys were dismissed from service and sentenced to ten years in jail for disobeying their officers. This happened on 9 May 1857. \nThe response of the other Indian soldiers in Meerut was quite extraordinary. On 10 May, the soldiers marched to the jail in Meerut and released the imprisoned sepoys. They attacked and killed British officers. They captured guns and ammunition and set fire to the buildings and properties of the British and declared war on the firangis. The soldiers were determined to bring an end to their rule in the country. But who would rule the land instead? The soldiers had an answer to this question \u2013 the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. \nThe sepoys of Meerut rode all night of 10 May to reach Delhi in the early hours next morning. As news of their arrival spread, the regiments stationed in Delhi also rose up in rebellion. Again british officers were killed, arms and ammunition seized, buildings set on fire. Triumphant soldiers gathered around the walls of the Red Fort where the Badshah lived, demanding to meet him. The emperor was not quite willing to challenge the mighty British power but the soldiers persisted. They forced their way into the palace and proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. \nThe ageing emperor had to accept this demand. He wrote letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight the British. This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had great implications. \nThe Mughal dynasty had ruled over a very large part of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains controlled dif ferent territories on behalf of the Mughal ruler. Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many of them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, they too would be able to rule their own territories once more, under Mughal authority. \nThe British had not expected this to happen. They thought the disturbance caused by the issue of the cartridges would die down. But Bahadur Shah Zafar\u2019s decision to bless the rebellion changed the entire situation dramatically. Often when people see an alternative possibility they feel inspired and enthused. It gives them the courage, hope and confidence to act. \nThe rebellion spreads \n After the British were routed from Delhi, there was no uprising for almost a week. It took that much time for news to travel. Then, a spurt of mutinies began. \nRegiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join other troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow. After them, the people of the towns and villages also rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to establish their authority and fight the British. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the late Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered armed forces and expelled the British garrison from the city. He proclaimed himself Peshwa. He declared that he was a governor under Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. In Lucknow, Birjis Qadr, the son of the deposed Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, was proclaimed the new Nawab. He too acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahadur Shah Zafar. His mother Begum Hazrat Mahal took an active part in organising the uprising against the British. In Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai joined the rebel sepoys and fought the British along with Tantia Tope, the general of Nana Saheb. In the Mandla region of Madhya Pradesh, Rani Avantibai Lodhi of Ramgarh raised and led an army of four thousand against the British who had taken over the administration of her state. \nThe British were greatly outnumbered by the rebel forces. They were defeated in a number of battles. This convinced the people that the rule of the British had collapsed for good and gave them the confidence to take the plunge and join the rebellion. A situation of widespread popular rebellion developed in the region of Awadh in particular. On 6 August 1857, we find a telegram sent by Lieutenant Colonel Tytler to his Commander-in-Chief expressing the fear felt by the British: \u201cOur men are cowed by the numbers opposed to them and the endless fighting. Every village is held against us, the zamindars have risen to oppose us.\u201d \nMany new leaders came up. For example, Ahmadullah Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, prophesied that the rule of the British would come to an end soon. He caught the imagination of the people and raised a huge force of supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British. In Delhi, a large number of ghazis or religious warriors came together to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came to Delhi. He became a key military leader of the rebellion. In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel sepoys and battled with the British for many months. Leaders and fighters from across the land joined the fight. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the initial sequence of events that led to the 1857 rebellion spreading from Meerut to Delhi, and explain the significance of Bahadur Shah Zafar's involvement."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly details the start of the rebellion in Meerut and its immediate spread.

These deities included Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as Durga. \nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti, an idea that became very popular at this time. Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti. \nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is included in the Mahabharata (see Chapter 12). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna, his devotee and friend, to abandon all dharmas and take refuge in him, as only he can set Arjuna free from every evil. This form of worship gradually spread to different parts of the country. \nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasised devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices. \nAccording to this system of belief, if a devotee worships the chosen deity with a pure heart, the deity will appear in the form in which he or she may desire. So, the deity could be thought of as a human being, lion, tree or any other form. Once this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities. \nBecause the deities were special, these images of the deity were often placed within special homes, places that we describe as temples. You will learn more about these temples in Chapter 12. Bhakti inspired some of the best expressions in art \u2014 sculpture, poetry and architecture. \nBhakti Comes from the Sanskrit term bhaj meaning \u2018to divide or share.\u2019 This suggests an intimate, two-way relationship between the deity and the devotee. Bhakti is directed towards Bhagavat, which is often translated as god, but also means one who possesses and shares bhaga, literally good fortune or bliss.

These included the Banjaras (see also Chapter 7). Several traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors who bought horses. \nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards \u2013 the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. \nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China. \nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive. This eventually drew European traders to India. We will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns. \nWith its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in present-day Afghanistan) became politically and commercially important from the sixteenth century onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was primarily carried on through this route. In the seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum in those days. Camels carried dried fruits, dates, carpets, silks and even fresh fruits from Kabul to the subcontinent and elsewhere. Slaves were also brought here for sale. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIn Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Take a look at Table 1 again and identify the five dynasties that together made the Delhi Sultanate. \nThe rulers of Delhi - Table 1 - RAJPUT DYNASTIES : Tomaras Early twelfth century-1165, Ananga Pala 1130-1145, Chauhans 1165-1192, Prithviraj Chauhan 1175-1192 - EARLY TURKISH RULERS 1206-1290 : Qutbuddin Aybak 1206-1210, Shamsuddin Iltutmish 1210-1236, Raziyya 1236-1240, Ghiyasuddin Balban 1266-1287 - KHALJI DYNASTY 1290-1320 : Jalaluddin Khalji 1290-1296, Alauddin Khalji 1296-1316 - TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 1320-1414 : Ghiyasuddin Tughluq 1320-1324, Muhammad Tughluq 1324-1351, Firuz Shah Tughluq 1351-1388 - SAYYID DYNASTY 1414-1451 : Khizr Khan 1414-1421 - LODI DYNASTY 1451-1526 : Bahlul Lodi 1451-1489 \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Shah Jahan's architectural choices, specifically the riverfront garden concept and the design of his audience halls, function to assert his imperial authority and influence urban structure in cities like Agra and Delhi?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text indicates that Shah Jahan adapted the 'river-front garden' in the layout of the Taj Mahal and in the new city of Shahjahanabad. This was explicitly developed 'as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river.' In Shahjahanabad, the 'imperial palace commanded the river-front,' and access was restricted to 'specially favoured nobles,' compelling others to build away from the River Yamuna. This demonstrates a clear intent to influence urban structure and exert control over the nobility's access to prime locations.\n\nRegarding his audience halls (diwan-i khas o am), the text states they were 'specially constructed to resemble a mosque.' The pedestal for his throne was often described as the 'qibla,' meaning everyone faced the emperor, which suggested 'the idea of the king as a representative of God on earth.' Additionally, pietra dura inlays behind the throne depicting Orpheus communicated 'that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals,' emphasizing 'royal justice and the imperial court.' These design elements were thus instrumental in projecting the king's divine authority and his role as the ultimate dispenser of justice.\n\nAnswer: Shah Jahan's architectural choices, such as the riverfront garden layout and the design of his audience halls, were strategically employed to assert his imperial authority and reshape urban dynamics. He used the riverfront garden concept, particularly in Shahjahanabad, to control nobles' access to the river, with the imperial palace commanding the waterfront. His audience halls were designed to resemble mosques, with the throne's pedestal described as the qibla, symbolizing the king as God's representative. Furthermore, pietra dura inlays in the halls emphasized the king's impartial justice, thereby reinforcing his supreme power and influence over both the physical city and the social hierarchy."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.5.5", "8.4.4", "7.6.5", "6.7.8", "7.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the immediate challenges India faced upon gaining independence in August 1947, and what broader problems did the new nation subsequently need to address?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that \"When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges.\" It identifies two immediate challenges: \"As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan\" who needed homes and jobs, and \"the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them,\" which had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The text confirms these were immediate by stating, \"The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately.\" For broader, longer-term issues, the text mentions that \"the new nation had to adopt a political system\" and highlights two major problems: \"unity\" and \"development.\" It details the unity problem stemming from a population of 345 million divided by castes, faiths, languages, and professions.

The text emphasizes that \"Unity and development had to go hand in hand.\"\n\nAnswer: Upon gaining independence in August 1947, India immediately faced the challenges of finding homes and jobs for 8 million refugees from Pakistan and persuading nearly 500 princely states to join the new nation. Subsequently, the new nation needed to address the broader problems of adopting a suitable political system, fostering unity among its diverse and divided population, and promoting development to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing agricultural productivity and creating new industries."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.9", "8.10.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The Mughals used one term \u2013 zamindars \u2013 to describe all intermediaries, whether they were local headmen of villages or powerful chieftains. \nAkbar\u2019s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried out a careful survey of crop yields, prices and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 1570- 1580. On the basis of this data, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. This revenue system was known as zabt. It was prevalent in those areas where Mughal administrators could survey the land and keep very careful accounts. This was not possible in provinces such as Gujarat and Bengal. \nIn some areas the zamindars exercised a great deal of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators could drive them to rebellion. Sometimes zamindars and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from the end of the seventeenth century. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies.

Both these industries were crucial for the industrial revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when its iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d. \nThe industrialisation of Britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of India. You have seen (Chapter 2) how the English East India Company\u2019s interest in trade led to occupation of territory, and how the pattern of trade changed over the decades. In the late eighteenth century the Company was buying goods in India and exporting them to England and Europe, making profit through this sale. With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India. How did this affect Indian crafts and industries? This is the question we will explore in this chapter. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nTwo of the words we often use for our country are India and Bharat.

Several traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors who bought horses. \nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards \u2013 the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. \nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China. \nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive. This eventually drew European traders to India. We will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns. \nWith its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in present-day Afghanistan) became politically and commercially important from the sixteenth century onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was primarily carried on through this route. In the seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum in those days.

Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people become different from wild plants and animals. This is because people select plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select those plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select plants that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of bearing the weight of the ripe grain. Seeds from selected plants are preserved and sown to ensure that new plants (and seeds) will have the same qualities. \nAmongst animals, those that are relatively gentle are selected for breeding. As a result, gradually, domesticated animals and plants become different from wild animals and plants. For example, the teeth and horns of wild animals are usually much larger than those of domesticated animals. \nDomestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts of the world.

Most houses had a separate bathing area, and some had wells to supply water. \nMany of these cities had covered drains. Notice how carefully these were laid out, in straight lines. Although you cannot see it, each drain had a gentle slope so that water could flow through it. Very often, drains in houses were connected to those on the streets and smaller drains led into bigger ones. As the drains were covered, inspection holes were provided at intervals to clean them.

(Note that used in this sense, the word does not refer to the different states which are found in a country.) \nPlanning for Development \n\n Lifting India and Indians out of poverty, and building a modern technical and industrial base were among the major objectives of the new nation. In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development. There was a broad agreement on what was called a \u201cmixed economy\u201d model. Here, both the State and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs. What, specifically, these roles were to be \u2013 which industries should be initiated by the state and which by the market, how to achieve a balance between the different regions and states \u2013 was to be defined by the Planning Commission. \nIn 1956, the Second Five Year Plan was formulated. This focused strongly on the development of heavy industries such as steel, and on the building of large dams. These sectors would be under the control of the State. This focus on heavy industry, and the effort at state regulation of the economy was to guide economic policy for the next few decades. This approach had many strong supporters, but also some vocal critics. \nSome felt that it had put inadequate emphasis on agriculture. Others argued that it had neglected primary education. Still others believed that it had not taken account of the environmental implications of economic policies. As Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s follower Mira Behn wrote in 1949, by \u201cscience and machinery he [mankind] may get huge returns for a time, but ultimately will come desolation.

Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what two distinct initiatives were undertaken by independent India concerning national planning and calendrical systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The second text section, 'Planning for Development', states that 'In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development' as one of the major objectives of the 'new nation' (independent India).

As they moved eastwards, they cleared forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new communities of peasants. \nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries received land and often set up mosques that served as centres for religious transformation in these areas. \nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. These were provided by community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People referred to them with affection and respect as pirs. \nPir : A Persian word meaning a spiritual guide. \nThis term included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal. \nAnimism : Attribution of living soul to plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena. \nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapters 2 and 5) that temples and other religious structures were often built by individuals or groups who were becoming powerful \u2013 to both demonstrate their power and proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several \u201clow\u201d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). The coming of the European trading companies created new economic opportunities; many families belonging to these social groups availed of these. As their social and economic position improved, they proclaimed their status through the construction of temples. When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts. (Remember the \u201cBangla dome\u201d in Chapter 5?) This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in temple architecture. \nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. Temples were usually built on a square platform. The interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, such decorations reached a high degree of excellence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTurn to Map 2 (page14). You will notice a number of blue squares. Each marks a site from where archaeologists have found evidence of early farmers and herders. These are found all over the subcontinent. Some of the most important ones are in the north-west, in present-day Kashmir, and in east and south India \nTo find out whether these sites were settlements of farmers and herders, scientists study evidence of plants and animal bones. One of the most exciting finds includes remains of burnt grain. (These may have been burnt accidentally or on purpose). Scientists can identify these grains, and so we know that a number of crops were grown in different parts of the subcontinent. They can also identify the bones of different animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nStone tools were probably made using two different techniques: 1. The first is called stone on stone. Here, the pebble from which the tool was to be made (also called the core) was held in one hand. Another stone, which was used as a hammer was held in the other hand. The second stone was used to strike off flakes from the first, till the required shape was obtained. 2. Pressure flaking: Here the core was placed on a firm surface. The hammer stone was used on a piece of bone or stone that was placed on the core, to remove flakes that could be shaped into tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere were several stages in building a stupa or a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to build these as it was an expensive affair. First, good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and transported to the place that was often carefully chosen for the new building. Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures. Besides, when devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, they often brought gifts, which were used to decorate the buildings. For example, an association of ivory workers paid for one of the beautiful gateways at Sanchi. \nAmong the others who paid for decorations were merchants, farmers, garland makers,perfumers, smiths, and hundreds of men and women who are known only by their names which were inscribed on pillars, railings and walls. So when you get a chance to visit any of these buildings, remember how several hundreds of people probably worked to construct and decorate them. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe Nation, Sixty Years On \n\n On 15 August 2007, India celebrated sixty years of its existence as a free nation. How well has the country done in this time? And to what extent has it fulfilled the ideals set out in its Constitution? \nThat India is still united, and that it is still democratic, are achievements that we might justly be proud of. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country, that it would break up into many parts, with each region or linguistic group seeking to form a nation of its own. Others believed that it would come under military rule. However, as many as thirteen general elections have been held since Independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections. There is a free press, as well as an independent judiciary.Finally, the fact that people speak different languages or practise different faiths has not come in the way of national unity. \nOn the other hand, deep divisions persist. Despite constitutional guarantees, the Untouchables or, as they are now referred to, the Dalits, face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks and otherpublic places. And despite the secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution, there have been clashes between different religious groups in many states. Above all, as many observers have noted, the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development. They live in large houses and dine in expensive restaurants, send their children to expensive private schools and take expensive foreign holidays. At the same time many others continue to live below the poverty line. Housed in urban slums, or living in remote villages on lands that yield little, they cannot afford to send their children to school. \nThe Constitution recognises equality before the law, but in real life some Indians are more equal than others. Judged by the standards it set itself at Independence, the Republic of India has not been a great success. But it has not been a failure either. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the diverse motivations and sources of patronage for the construction and decoration of religious structures like temples and stupas, and how did these vary or overlap?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question requires synthesizing information from multiple sections regarding the construction and patronage of religious structures. \n\n1.  **Section 2 (Bengal Migration and Temple Building)** discusses temple building in Bengal from the late fifteenth century.

Powerful individuals or groups, including kings and queens, built these structures to demonstrate their power, proclaim their piety, and as an expensive affair funded from their treasuries. In Bengal, 'low' social groups such as Kolu and Kansari also constructed temples to proclaim their improved social and economic status.

The only time they stayed in one place was during the rainy season, when it was very difficult to travel. Then, their supporters built temporary shelters for them in gardens, or they lived in natural caves in hilly areas. \nAs time went on, many supporters of the monks and nuns, and they themselves, felt the need for more permanent shelters and so monasteries were built. These were known as viharas. The earliest viharas were made of wood, and then of brick. Some were even in caves that were dug out in hills, especially in western India. \nVery often, the land on which the vihara was built was donated by a rich merchant or a landowner, or the king.

These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals.

The Brahmins were expected to study and teach the Vedas, perform sacrifices, and receive gifts. The Kshatriyas (rulers) were to fight battles and protect people. The Vaishyas (vish) were farmers, herders, and traders, and both Kshatriyas and Vaishyas could perform sacrifices. The Shudras were to serve the other three groups, could not perform rituals, and along with women, were not allowed to study the Vedas. Later, some craftspersons, hunters, gatherers, and those performing burials/cremations were classified as untouchables, with contact considered polluting.\n\nMany people rejected this system for several reasons: some kings believed they were superior to priests; others felt birth was not a valid basis for varna; some argued against occupational differences determining social standing; some believed everyone should be able to perform rituals; and the practice of untouchability was condemned. Furthermore, in certain regions like the north-east, social and economic differences were less pronounced, limiting the influence of the priests."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.10.3", "6.7.7", "6.6.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAmongst the states that were carved out of the old Mughal provinces in the eighteenth century, three stand out very prominently. These were Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. All three states were founded by members of the high Mughal nobility who had been governors of large provinces \u2013 Sa\u2018adat Khan (Awadh), Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad). All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both Asaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Sa\u2018adat Khan\u2019s zat was 6,000. \nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state (1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had already gained control over its political and financial administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the actual ruler of that region. \nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. \nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2). \nA description of the Nizam of Hyderabad\u2019s personal troopers in 1790: \u2026The Nizam has a swaree (sawari) of 400 elephants, several thousand of horsemen near his person who receive upwards 100 R(upees)s nominal pay (and) are extremely well mounted and richly caparisoned \nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire. Awadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. In other words, he was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh. \nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawab\u2019s court. He seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand. \nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past. \nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Like the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars. \nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenthcentury Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars. The close connection between the state and bankers \u2013 noticeable in Hyderabad and Awadh as well \u2013 was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756). During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous. \nIf we take a bird\u2019s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states. First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably. The third common feature in all these regional states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n7 Civilising the \u201cNative\u201d, Educating the Nation \n\n Linguist \u2013 Someone who knows and studies several languages. \n Madrasa \u2013 An Arabic word for a place of learning; any type of school or college. \n Orientalists \u2013 Those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of Asia. \n Munshi \u2013 A person who can read, write and teach Persian. \n Vernacular \u2013 A term generally used to refer to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is seen as the standard language. In colonial countries like India, the British used the term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English \u2013 the language of the imperial masters. \nIn the earlier chapters you have seen how British rule affected rajas and nawabs, peasants and tribals. In this chapter we will try and understand what implication it had for the lives of students. For, the British in India wanted not only territorial conquest and control over revenues. They also felt that they had a cultural mission: they had to \u201ccivilise the natives\u201d, change their customs and values. What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, \u201ccivilised\u201d, and made into what the British believed were \u201cgood subjects\u201d? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many decades. \nHow the British saw Education \n\n Let us look at what the British thought and did, and how some of the ideas of education that we now take for granted evolved in the last two hundred years. In the process of this enquiry we will also see how Indians reacted to British ideas, and how they developed their own views about how Indians were to be educated. \nThe tradition of Orientalism In 1783, a person named William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He had an appointment as a junior judge at the Supreme Court that the Company had set up. In addition to being an expert in law, Jones was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English, had picked up Arabic from a friend, and had also learnt Persian. At Calcutta, he began spending many hours a day with pandits who taught him the subtleties of Sanskrit language, grammar and poetry. Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy, religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and the other sciences. \nJones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials living in Calcutta at the time. Englishmen like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with them, Jones set up the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and started a journal called Asiatick Researches. \nJones and Colebrooke came to represent a particular attitude towards India. They shared a deep respect for ancient cultures, both of India and the West. Indian civilisation, they felt, had attained its glory in the ancient past, but had subsequently declined. In order to understand India it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient period. For only those texts could reveal the real ideas and laws of the Hindus and Muslims, and only a new study of these texts could form the basis of future development in India. \nSo Jones and Colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts, understanding their meaning, translating them, and making their findings known to others. This project, they believed, would not only help the British learn from Indian culture, but it would also help Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters. \nInfluenced by such ideas, many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote Indian rather than Western learning. They felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. The officials also thought that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with, and what they valued and treasured, not subjects that were alien to them. Only then, they believed, could the British hope to win a place in the hearts of the \u201cnatives\u201d; only then could the alien rulers expect to be respected by their subjects. \nWith this object in view a madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 to promote the study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law; and the Hindu College was established in Benaras in 1791 to encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country. Not all officials shared these views. Many were very strong in their criticism of the Orientalists. \n\u201cGrave errors of the East\u201d \n From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticise the Orientalist vision of learning. They said that knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought; Eastern literature was non-serious and light-hearted. So they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature. \nJames Mill was one of those who attacked the Orientalists. The British effort, he declared, should not be to teach what the natives wanted, or what they respected, in order to please them and \u201cwin a place in their heart\u201d. The aim of education ought to be to teach what was useful and practical. So Indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the West had made, rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the Orient. \nBy the 1830s the attack on the Orientalists became sharper. One of the most outspoken and influential of such critics of the time was Thomas Babington Macaulay. He saw India as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised. No branch of Eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced. Who could deny, declared Macaulay, that \u201ca single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia\u201d. He urged that the British government in India stop wasting public money in promoting Oriental learning, for it was of no practical use. \nWith great energy and passion, Macaulay emphasised the need to teach the English language. He felt that knowledge of English would allow Indians to read some of the finest literature the world had produced; it would make them aware of the developments in Western science and philosophy. Teaching of English could thus be a way of civilising people, changing their tastes, values and culture. \nFollowing Macaulay\u2019s minute, the English Education Act of 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College. These institutions were seen as \u201ctemples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay\u201d. English textbooks now began to be produced for schools. \nEducation for commerce \n In 1854, the Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor-General in India. Issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it has come to be known as Wood\u2019s Despatch. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge. \nOne of the practical uses the Despatch pointed to was economic. European learning, it said, would enable Indians to recognise the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce, and make them see the importance of developing the resources of the country. Introducing them to European ways of life, would change their tastes and desires, and create a demand for British goods, for Indians would begin to appreciate and buy things that were produced in Europe. \nFollowing the 1854 Despatch, several measures were introduced by the British. Education departments of the government were set up to extend control over all matters regarding education. Steps were taken to establish a system of university education. In 1857, while the sepoys rose in revolt in Meerut and Delhi, universities were being established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education. \nThe demand for moral education \n The argument for practical education was strongly criticised by the Christian missionaries in India in the nineteenth century. The missionaries felt that education should attempt to improve the moral character of the people, and morality could be improved only through Christian education. \nUntil 1813, the East India Company was opposed to missionary activities in India. It feared that missionary activities would provoke reaction amongst the local population and make them suspicious of British presence in India. Unable to establish an institution within British-controlled territories, the missionaries set up a mission at Serampore in an area under the control of the Danish East India Company. A printing press was set up in 1800 and a college established in 1818. \nOver the nineteenth century, missionary schools were set up all over India. After 1857, however, the British government in India was reluctant to directly support missionary education. There was a feeling that any strong attack on local customs, practices, beliefs and religious ideas might enrage \u201cnative\u201d opinion. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nProvincial autonomy - Capacity of the provinces to make relatively independent decisions while remaining within a federation. \nThe March to Dandi \n Purna Swaraj would never come on its own. It had to be fought for. In 1930, Gandhiji declared that he would lead a march to break the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi along with other nationalists reasoned that it was sinful to tax salt since it is such an essential item of our food. The Salt March related the general desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by everybody, and thus did not divide the rich and the poor. \nGandhiji and his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt. Peasants, tribals and women participated in large numbers. A business federation published a pamphlet on the salt issue. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were sent to jail. \nThe combined struggles of the Indian people bore fruit when the Government of India Act of 1935 prescribed provincial autonomy and the government announced elections to the provincial legislatures in 1937. The Congress formed governments in 7 out of 11 provinces. \nIn September 1939, after two years of Congress rule in the provinces, the Second World War broke out. Critical of Hitler, Congress leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to concede the demand. The Congress ministries resigned in protest. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nDomestication is the name given to the process in which people grow plants and look after animals. Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people become different from wild plants and animals. This is because people select plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select those plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select plants that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of bearing the weight of the ripe grain. Seeds from selected plants are preserved and sown to ensure that new plants (and seeds) will have the same qualities. \nAmongst animals, those that are relatively gentle are selected for breeding. As a result, gradually, domesticated animals and plants become different from wild animals and plants. For example, the teeth and horns of wild animals are usually much larger than those of domesticated animals. \nDomestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts of the world. It began about 12,000 years ago. Virtually all the plant and animal produce that we use as food today is a result of domestication. Some of the earliest plants to be domesticated were wheat and barley. The earliest domesticated animals include sheep and goat. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Trace the evolution of British educational policy in India from the late 18th-century Orientalist approach to the implementation of the English Education Act of 1835, highlighting the key ideas and influential figures behind these changes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes the evolution of British educational policy in India. Initially, in the late 18th century, figures like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, and Nathaniel Halhed represented the Orientalist tradition. They held deep respect for ancient Indian culture, believing its civilization had attained glory in the past and that rediscovering ancient sacred and legal texts was crucial for India's future development. This led to the establishment of institutions like the Calcutta Madrasa (1781) to promote Arabic, Persian, and Islamic law, and the Hindu College in Benaras (1791) for ancient Sanskrit texts. However, from the early 19th century, this view faced criticism. James Mill argued that British education should focus on what was 'useful and practical,' introducing Indians to Western scientific and technical advances rather than Oriental literature. The criticism intensified by the 1830s with Thomas Babington Macaulay, who considered India uncivilized and Eastern knowledge inferior. Macaulay passionately advocated for teaching the English language, believing it would civilize Indians and expose them to Western science and philosophy. His influence led to the English Education Act of 1835, which mandated English as the medium of instruction for higher education and ended the promotion of Oriental institutions.\n\nAnswer: British educational policy in India evolved from the late 18th-century Orientalist tradition, championed by figures like William Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, and Nathaniel Halhed, who promoted the study of ancient Indian texts and languages (e.g., through the Calcutta Madrasa and Hindu College).

Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n3 Ruling the Countryside \n\n The Company Becomes the Diwan \n On 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLike earlier rulers, some of these kings maintained a well-organised army, with elephants, chariots, cavalry and foot soldiers. Besides, there were military leaders who provided the king with troops whenever he needed them. They were not paid regular salaries. Instead, some of them received grants of land. They collected revenue from the land and used this to maintain soldiers and horses, and provide equipment for warfare. These men were known as samantas. Whenever the ruler was weak, samantas tried to become independent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary land revenue systems introduced by the East India Company after becoming the Diwan of Bengal, what were their key features, and why did the Company repeatedly seek to change them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text establishes that the East India Company was appointed as the Diwan of Bengal on 12 August 1765, making it the chief financial administrator.\n2. The first major land revenue system introduced was the Permanent Settlement in 1793. Its key features were recognizing rajas and taluqdars as zamindars, who were responsible for collecting rent from peasants and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. The Company's intention was to ensure a regular revenue flow and encourage zamindars to invest in land improvement.\n3. The Company sought to change this system because problems arose: zamindars often did not invest in land improvement, the fixed revenue was too high for many, leading to zamindaris being sold off, and the Company could not increase its revenue even as market prices rose and cultivation expanded in the early 19th century.\n4. This led to the introduction of the Mahalwari Settlement, devised by Holt Mackenzie and effective in 1822 in the North Western Provinces. Its key features included calculating the estimated revenue of each plot within a village (mahal) and adding them up to determine the village's payment. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed, and the village headman was responsible for collection instead of zamindars.\n5. In the British territories in the south, the Ryotwari (or Munro) system was developed. Its key feature was making settlements directly with the cultivators (ryots) after carefully surveying their fields, as there were no traditional zamindars in these areas.\n6. The text indicates that 'all was not well' with these new systems too. Revenue officials often fixed demands too high, leading to peasants being unable to pay, fleeing the countryside, and villages becoming deserted. The repeated changes were driven by the Company's continuous desire to increase its income from land and address the shortcomings and problems created by the preceding systems.\n\nAnswer: After becoming the Diwan of Bengal in 1765, the East India Company introduced several land revenue systems. The first was the Permanent Settlement in 1793, which recognized rajas and taluqdars as zamindars responsible for collecting rent and paying a permanently fixed revenue to the Company. This system was changed because zamindars failed to invest in land improvement, the revenue demand was too high for many, and the Company could not increase its income despite rising prices and expanding cultivation. Subsequently, the Mahalwari Settlement was introduced in 1822 in the North Western Provinces, where revenue was assessed per village (mahal), revised periodically, and collected by the village headman. In the southern territories, the Ryotwari (or Munro) system was devised, making direct settlements with cultivators (ryots) after surveying their fields. The Company repeatedly sought changes because revenue demands were often fixed too high, leading to widespread peasant distress, desertion of villages, and a failure to secure a stable and increasing revenue flow."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.11.8", "8.3.1", "7.4.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor- General (1798-1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. \nTipu Sultan \u2013 The \u201cTiger of Mysore\u201d The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. \nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1781 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close relationship with the French in India, and modernised his army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious, arrogant and dangerous \u2013 rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1787-89, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \nWar with the Marathas \n From the late eighteenth century the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1781, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy \n It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, carried on the resistance. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book. \nIn the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab was annexed. \nThe Doctrine of Lapse \n The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1858. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1858, the Company also took over Awadh. This time the British had an added argument \u2013 they said they were \u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nVikram Samvat The era beginning in the 58 BCE is traditionally associated with Gupta king, Chandragupta II, who had founded it as a mark of victory over the Shakas and assumed the title of Vikramaditya. The Vikram Samvat has also been adopted alongside the Gregorian calendar as the national calendar by independent India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n3 Ruling the Countryside \n\n The Company Becomes the Diwan \n On 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. The actual event most probably took place in Robert Clive\u2019s tent, with a few Englishmen and Indians as witnesses. But in the painting above, the event is shown as a majestic occasion, taking place in a grand setting. The painter was commissioned by Clive to record the memorable events in Clive\u2019s life. The grant of Diwani clearly was one such event in British imagination. \nAs Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the territory under its control. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. \nOver the years the Company also learnt that it had to move with some caution. Being an alien power, it needed to pacify those who in the past had ruled the countryside, and enjoyed authority and prestige. Those who had held local power had to be controlled but they could not be entirely eliminated. How was this to be done? In this chapter we will see how the Company came to colonise the countryside, organise revenue resources, redefine the rights of people, and produce the crops it wanted. \nRevenue for the Company \n The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. The effort was to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1865, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. \nSoon it was clear that the Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770 a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. About one-third of the population was wiped out. \nThe need to improve agriculture \n If the economy was in ruins, could the Company be certain of its revenue income? Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. How was this to be done? After two decades of debate on the question, the Company finally introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company\u2019s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land. \nThe problem \n The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. Company officials soon discovered that the zamindars were in fact not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue that had been fixed was so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari. Numerous zamindaris were sold off at auctions organised by the Company. \nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century the situation changed. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently \nEven then the zamindars did not have an interest in improving the land. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. As long as the zamindars could give out the land to tenants and get rent, they were not interested in improving the land. \nOn the other hand, in the villages, the cultivator found the system extremely oppressive. The rent he paid to the zamindar was high and his right on the land was insecure. To pay the rent he had to often take a loan from the moneylender, and when he failed to pay the rent he was evicted from the land he had cultivated for generations. \nMahal \u2013 In British revenue records mahal is a revenue estate which may be a village or a group of villages. \n A new system is devised By the early nineteenth century many of the Company officials were convinced that the system of revenue had to be changed again. How could revenues be fixed permanently at a time when the Company needed more money to meet its expenses of administration and trade? \nIn the North Western Provinces of the Bengal Presidency (most of this area is now in Uttar Pradesh), an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie devised the new system which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society and needed to be preserved. Under his directions, collectors went from village to village, inspecting the land, measuring the fields, and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village (mahal) had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically, not permanently fixed. The charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company was given to the village headman, rather than the zamindar. This system came to be known as the mahalwari settlement. \nThe Munro system \n In the British territories in the south there was a similar move away from the idea of Permanent Settlement. The new system that was devised came to be known as the ryotwar (or ryotwari ). It was tried on a small scale by Captain Alexander Read in some of the areas that were taken over by the Company after the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over south India. \nRead and Munro felt that in the south there were no traditional zamindars. The settlement, they argued, had to be made directly with the cultivators (ryots) who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields had to be carefully and separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made. Munro thought that the British should act as paternal father figures protecting the ryots under their charge. \nAll was not well \n Within a few years after the new systems were imposed it was clear that all was not well with them. Driven by the desire to increase the income from land, revenue officials fixed too high a revenue demand. Peasants were unable to pay, ryots fled the countryside, and villages became deserted in many regions. Optimistic officials had imagined that the new systems would transform the peasants into rich enterprising farmers. But this did not happen. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAround 2500 years ago, the people of Athens set up a form of government, which was called a democracy, which lasted for about 200 years. \nAll free men over the age of 30 were recognised as full citizens. There was an assembly that met at least 40 times a year to decide on important matters. All citizens could attend these meetings. \nAppointments for many positions were made through lottery. All those who wanted to be chosen gave in their names, and then some were selected through lottery. \nCitizens were expected to serve in the army and the navy. However, women were not considered citizens. Also, many foreigners, who lived and worked in Athens as merchants and crafts persons did not have rights as citizens. \nBesides, there were several thousand slaves in Athens, who worked in mines, fields, households and workshops. They too were not treated as citizens. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Analyze the multifaceted strategies employed by the East India Company to expand and consolidate its control over Indian territories, and evaluate the resulting social and economic impacts on the local population."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The East India Company employed a combination of political, economic, diplomatic, military, and administrative strategies to expand and consolidate its control. Initially, the Company rarely launched direct military attacks on unknown territory, instead using 'political, economic and diplomatic methods' (Company Rule Expands). This included appointing 'Residents' in Indian states after the Battle of Buxar (1784) to interfere in internal affairs, influencing succession and administrative appointments. A key economic and military strategy was the 'subsidiary alliance,' which disallowed Indian rulers from having independent armed forces, requiring them to pay for Company protection, with non-payment leading to territorial annexation (e.g., Awadh in 1801, Hyderabad). \n\nDirect military confrontation was used when the Company perceived a threat to its interests, as seen in the four wars against Mysore, culminating in Tipu Sultan's death in 1799 and the imposition of a subsidiary alliance. Similarly, Maratha power was curbed through a series of wars, leading to significant territorial gains for the British (e.g., Orissa, Agra, Delhi after the Second Anglo-Maratha War) and the eventual removal of the Peshwa. Later, under Lord Hastings (1813-1823), the policy of 'paramountcy' asserted the Company's supreme authority, justifying the annexation of any Indian kingdom. This was followed by Lord Dalhousie's (1848-1858) 'Doctrine of Lapse,' which annexed kingdoms if a ruler died without a male heir (e.g., Satara, Jhansi). Awadh was annexed in 1858 under the pretext of 'misgovernment.' The Company also expanded into the north-west due to fears of Russia, leading to wars in Afghanistan, and the annexation of Sind (1843) and Punjab (1849).\n\nAdministratively and economically, the Company became the 'Diwan of Bengal' in 1765, making it the chief financial administrator. Initially, it sought to maximize revenue without a regular system, leading to a 'deep crisis' in the Bengal economy, with artisans deserting villages, peasants unable to pay dues, and a 'terrible famine' in 1770 that killed ten million people. To secure revenue, the 'Permanent Settlement' was introduced in 1793, recognizing rajas and taluqdars as zamindars responsible for collecting fixed revenue. However, this policy failed as zamindars did not invest in land improvement and cultivators found the system 'extremely oppressive,' leading to high rents, insecure land rights, and evictions. Later, new revenue systems were devised: the 'Mahalwari Settlement' (1822) in the North Western Provinces, which assessed revenue per village (mahal) and revised it periodically, and the 'Ryotwari' or 'Munro system' in the south, which made direct settlements with cultivators (ryots). Despite these changes, 'all was not well,' as high revenue demands led to peasants being 'unable to pay,' 'ryots fled the countryside,' and 'villages became deserted in many regions.' These policies also led to significant resistance, such as Rani Channamma and Rayanna in Kitoor, and the people of Awadh joining the 1857 revolt.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company employed a range of strategies including political interference through Residents, imposing 'subsidiary alliances,' direct military conquests (e.g., Mysore, Marathas), asserting 'paramountcy,' and using the 'Doctrine of Lapse' to annex territories. Administratively, after becoming the Diwan of Bengal, it implemented revenue systems like the 'Permanent Settlement,' 'Mahalwari Settlement,' and 'Ryotwari' system. These policies resulted in severe social and economic impacts, including the economic collapse of Bengal, a terrible famine in 1770, widespread peasant oppression, insecure land rights, deserted villages, and significant resistance movements against Company rule."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.11.3", "8.2.3", "6.6.9", "8.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous.

It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAmongst the states that were carved out of the old Mughal provinces in the eighteenth century, three stand out very prominently.

All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both Asaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Sa\u2018adat Khan\u2019s zat was 6,000. \nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state (1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had already gained control over its political and financial administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the actual ruler of that region. \nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. \nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2). \nA description of the Nizam of Hyderabad\u2019s personal troopers in 1790: \u2026The Nizam has a swaree (sawari) of 400 elephants, several thousand of horsemen near his person who receive upwards 100 R(upees)s nominal pay (and) are extremely well mounted and richly caparisoned \nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire. Awadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. In other words, he was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh. \nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawab\u2019s court. He seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand. \nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past. \nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Like the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars. \nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenthcentury Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars. The close connection between the state and bankers \u2013 noticeable in Hyderabad and Awadh as well \u2013 was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756). During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous. \nIf we take a bird\u2019s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states. First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably. The third common feature in all these regional states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThis was also the time when the worship of certain deities, which became a central feature of later Hinduism, gained in importance. These deities included Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as Durga. \nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti, an idea that became very popular at this time. Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti. \nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is included in the Mahabharata (see Chapter 12). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna, his devotee and friend, to abandon all dharmas and take refuge in him, as only he can set Arjuna free from every evil. This form of worship gradually spread to different parts of the country. \nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasised devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices. \nAccording to this system of belief, if a devotee worships the chosen deity with a pure heart, the deity will appear in the form in which he or she may desire. So, the deity could be thought of as a human being, lion, tree or any other form. Once this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities. \nBecause the deities were special, these images of the deity were often placed within special homes, places that we describe as temples. You will learn more about these temples in Chapter 12. Bhakti inspired some of the best expressions in art \u2014 sculpture, poetry and architecture. \nBhakti Comes from the Sanskrit term bhaj meaning \u2018to divide or share.\u2019 This suggests an intimate, two-way relationship between the deity and the devotee. Bhakti is directed towards Bhagavat, which is often translated as god, but also means one who possesses and shares bhaga, literally good fortune or bliss. The devotee, known as the bhakta or the bhagavata, shares his or her chosen deity\u2019s bhaga. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nHow did the Cholas rise to power? A minor chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, who belonged to the ancient chiefly family of the Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess Nishumbhasudini there. \nThe successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and north were made part of this kingdom. Map 2 The Chola kingdom and its neighbours. Rajaraja I, considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became king in 985 and expanded control over most of these areas. He also reorganised the administration of the empire. Rajaraja\u2019s son Rajendra I continued his policies and even raided the Ganga valley, Sri Lanka and countries of Southeast Asia, developing a navy for these expeditions. \nThe big temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, built by Rajaraja and Rajendra, are architectural and sculptural marvels. \nChola temples often became the nuclei of settlements which grew around them. These were centres of craft production. Temples were also endowed with land by rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land went into maintaining all the specialists who worked at the temple and very often lived near it \u2013 priests, garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, etc. In other words, temples were not only places of worship; they were the hub of economic, social and cultural life as well. \nAmongst the crafts associated with temples, the making of bronze images was the most distinctive. Chola bronze images are considered amongst the finest in the world. While most images were of deities, sometimes images were made of devotees as well. \nMany of the achievements of the Cholas were made possible through new developments in agriculture. Look at Map 2 again. Notice that the river Kaveri branches off into several small channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. These channels overflow frequently, depositing fertile soil on their banks. Water from the channels also provides the necessary moisture for agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. \nAlthough agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of Tamil Nadu, it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large-scale cultivation. Forests had to be cleared in some regions; land had to be levelled in other areas. In the delta region embankments had to be built to prevent flooding and canals had to be constructed to carry water to the fields. In many areas two crops were grown in a year. \nIn many cases it was necessary to water crops artificially. A variety of methods were used for irrigation. In some areas wells were dug. In other places huge tanks were constructed to collect rainwater. Remember that irrigation works require planning \u2013 organising labour and resources, maintaining these works and deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an active interest in these activities. \nHow was the administration organised? Settlements of peasants, known as ur, became prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu. The village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. \nRich peasants of the Vellala caste exercised considerable control over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central Chola government. The Chola kings gave some rich landowners titles like muvendavelan (a velan or peasant serving three kings), araiyar (chief), etc. as markers of respect, and entrusted them with important offices of the state at the centre. \nChola inscriptions mention several categories of land: vellanvagai land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors brahmadeya land gifted to Brahmanas shalabhoga land for the maintenance of a school devadana, tirunamattukkani land gifted to temples pallichchhandam land donated to Jaina institutions \nWe have seen that Brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya. As a result, a large number of Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley as in other parts of south India. \nEach brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent Brahmana landholders. These assemblies worked very efficiently. Their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone walls of temples. Associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns. \nInscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in which the sabha was organised. The sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works, gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to be members of these committees were written on small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for each committee. \nWho could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur inscription lays down: All those who wish to become members of the sabha should be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. They should have their own homes. They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. They should have knowledge of the Vedas. They should be well-versed in administrative matters and honest. If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of his relatives, cannot contest the elections. While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfthcentury Tamil work, which informs us about the lives of ordinary men and women. On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas (a name used for a social group considered \u201coutcastes\u201d by Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing about, carrying little puppies \u2026 In the shade of the marudu (arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny Pulaiyar (plural) to their day\u2019s work; and by day, under the shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the administrative and revenue collection systems of the Chola kingdom differ from those employed by the eighteenth-century Mughal successor states of Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Chola System (from 'Cholas' section):** The Chola administration was characterized by settlements of peasants ('ur') and groups of villages ('nadu') that performed administrative functions, including dispensing justice and collecting taxes. Rich peasants of the Vellala caste held significant control, supervised by the central Chola government. Land was categorized (e.g., 'vellanvagai' for non-Brahmana peasant proprietors, 'brahmadeya' gifted to Brahmanas). Assemblies ('sabha') of prominent Brahmana landholders managed 'brahmadeyas', with detailed rules for membership and committees for tasks like irrigation, as described in the Uttaramerur inscription. This indicates a system where local bodies, specific land grants, and community-level management were central to administration and revenue. \n2.  **Mughal Successor States System (from 'Mughal Successor States' section):** These states (Awadh, Bengal, Hyderabad) were founded by former Mughal nobles who sought to reduce Mughal influence, specifically by decreasing the number of Mughal-appointed 'jagirdars' and reassessing revenues. A defining feature of their tax collection was the contracting with 'revenue-farmers' (ijaradars) who would pay a fixed sum to the state and were granted considerable freedom in assessing and collecting taxes. These states also heavily relied on local bankers and 'mahajans' for loans, with bankers often guaranteeing the payment of the contracted revenue amounts. This led to new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, influencing the state\u2019s revenue management, marking a departure from previous practices. \n3.  **Comparison:** The Chola system involved local administrative units and assemblies directly managing land and collecting taxes, often through peasant proprietors and Brahmana landholders, focusing on an organized, community-based approach with specific land categories. In contrast, the Mughal successor states adopted a more commercialized approach by outsourcing tax collection to 'revenue-farmers' (ijaradars) who were financially backed and guaranteed by powerful bankers and moneylenders, thereby integrating financial intermediaries into the state's revenue system and moving away from the traditional 'jagirdari' system.\n\nAnswer: The Chola kingdom's administrative and revenue collection systems relied on local units like 'ur' and 'nadu,' with rich Vellala peasants and Brahmana assemblies ('sabha') managing land and collecting taxes, often directly or through specific land grants. Conversely, the eighteenth-century Mughal successor states (Awadh, Bengal, Hyderabad) shifted away from the 'jagirdari' system, instead employing 'revenue-farmers' (ijaradars) to collect taxes for a fixed sum, and significantly depended on local bankers and moneylenders for loans and to guarantee these revenue payments, thus integrating commercial intermediaries into their fiscal management."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.10", "7.2.5", "7.10.4", "6.10.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Which do you think is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture or coparcenary ? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the historical development of the Bengali language and differentiate between the two main categories of early Bengali literature, including examples and dating information for each."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) indicated that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages.

Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun.

It further notes that the Christians of Kerala, known as Syrian Christians, 'probably came from West Asia.' This establishes India's historical connection with West Asia regarding Christianity's arrival. The second text describes Indian textiles being 'extensively traded in Southeast Asia... and West and Central Asia.' It also mentions that European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India 'carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq,' which is in West Asia, highlighting the textile trade connection. Regarding the impact of European demand on Britain's industry, the text states that 'From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe.' The popularity led to 'wool and silk makers in England' protesting, which resulted in the British government enacting the 'Calico Act' in 1720, banning printed cotton textiles to protect nascent English industries. Moreover, 'Competition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England,' leading to inventions like the spinning jenny (1764) and the steam engine (1786).\n\nAnswer: India had historical connections with West Asia through the arrival of Christianity, as the first Christian preachers came from West Asia to India's west coast within a hundred years of Christ\u2019s death, and Kerala's Syrian Christians are believed to have originated from there. Furthermore, Indian textiles were extensively traded in West and Central Asia, with European traders initially encountering Indian cloth carried by Arab merchants in Mosul, Iraq. The European demand for Indian textiles led to significant impacts on Britain's industry, including protests from local manufacturers, the enactment of the Calico Act in 1720 to ban Indian printed cotton textiles, and a push for technological innovations like the spinning jenny and the steam engine to compete with Indian goods."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.10", "8.6.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom. \nAfter the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents, the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes the Company forced the states into a \u201csubsidiary alliance\u201d. According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, when Richard Wellesley was Governor- General (1798-1805), the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801, as he failed to pay for the \u201csubsidiary forces\u201d. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. \nTipu Sultan \u2013 The \u201cTiger of Mysore\u201d The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. \nMysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali (ruled from 1781 to 1782) and his famous son Tipu Sultan (ruled from 1782 to 1799). Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood, pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close relationship with the French in India, and modernised his army with their help. \nThe British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious, arrogant and dangerous \u2013 rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore (1787-89, 1780-84, 1790-92 and 1799). Only in the last \u2013 the Battle of Seringapatam \u2013 did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam, Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state. \nWar with the Marathas \n From the late eighteenth century the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1781, the Marathas\u2019 dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs (sardars) belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa (Principal Minister) who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century. \nThe Marathas were subdued in a series of wars. In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai, there was no clear victor. The Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) was fought on different fronts, resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally, the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas. \nThe claim to paramountcy \n It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings (Governor-General from 1813 to 1823) a new policy of \u201cparamountcy\u201d was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well. \nThis process, however, did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor, carried on the resistance. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book. \nIn the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839, two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom. Ultimately, in 1849, Punjab was annexed. \nThe Doctrine of Lapse \n The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1858. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine: Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853) and Jhansi (1854). \nFinally, in 1858, the Company also took over Awadh. This time the British had an added argument \u2013 they said they were \u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab! Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed, the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nZoroaster was an Iranian prophet. His teachings are contained in a book called the Avesta. The language of the Avesta, and the practices described in it are very similar to those of the Vedas. The basic teachings of Zoroaster are contained in the maxim \u201cGood thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.\u201d Here is a verse from the Zend Avesta: \u201cLord, grant strength and the rule of truth and good thinking, by means of which one shall create peace and tranquillity.\u201d \nFor more than a thousand years, Zoroastrianism was a major religion in Iran. Later, some Zoroastrians migrated from Iran and settled down in the coastal towns of Gujarat and Maharashtra. They were the ancestors of today\u2019s Parsis. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Between 1757 and 1858, what were the primary strategies and policies employed by the East India Company to expand its influence and annex Indian states, according to the text, and provide specific examples for each?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details several methods used by the East India Company for expansion and annexation. \n1.  **Political, Economic, and Diplomatic Methods:** The text states the Company 'used a variety of political, economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom.'\n2.  **Appointing Residents:** After the Battle of Buxar (1784), the Company appointed 'Residents in Indian states' who interfered in internal affairs, trying to decide 'who was to be the successor to the throne, and who was to be appointed in administrative posts.'\n3.  **Subsidiary Alliance:** Indian rulers were 'not allowed to have their independent armed forces' and had to pay for 'subsidiary forces' maintained by the Company. Failure to pay resulted in territory being taken away, such as the 'Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801' and 'Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.' A subsidiary alliance was also 'imposed on' Mysore after its defeat.\n4.  **Direct Military Confrontation:** This was resorted to 'when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests.' Examples include the 'Four wars' fought with Mysore, culminating in the Battle of Seringapatam in 1799 where Tipu Sultan was killed. The Company also sought to 'curb and eventually destroy Maratha power' through a 'series of wars,' including the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05) which led to the British gaining Orissa and territories north of the Yamuna, and the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-19) that 'crushed Maratha power.'\n5.  **Policy of Paramountcy:** Under Lord Hastings (1813-1823), the Company 'claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme,' justifying 'annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom' to protect its interests.\n6.  **Securing North-West:** Driven by fear of Russian expansion, the British fought a 'prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842,' took 'Sind over in 1843,' and annexed 'Punjab' in 1849 after two wars following Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death.\n7.  **Doctrine of Lapse:** Devised by Lord Dalhousie (1848-1858), this policy declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir, 'his kingdom would \u201clapse\u201d, that is, become part of Company territory.' Examples include Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853), and Jhansi (1854).\n8.  **Pretext of Misgovernment:** The Company took over Awadh in 1858, claiming they were '\u201cobliged by duty\u201d to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the \u201cmisgovernment\u201d of the Nawab!'\n\nAnswer: Between 1757 and 1858, the East India Company employed several strategies and policies to expand its influence and annex Indian states:\n\n1.  **Political, Economic, and Diplomatic Methods:** Used generally to extend influence before direct annexation.\n2.  **Appointment of Residents:** Agents appointed in Indian states (e.g., after the Battle of Buxar) interfered in internal affairs, including succession and administrative appointments.\n3.  **Subsidiary Alliance:** Rulers were denied independent armed forces and had to pay for Company protection. Failure to pay resulted in territory annexation, as seen with the Nawab of Awadh (1801) and Hyderabad, and Mysore after its defeat.\n4.  **Direct Military Confrontation:** Employed when political or economic interests were threatened. Examples include the four wars with Mysore, leading to Tipu Sultan's defeat in 1799, and a series of wars against the Marathas (e.g., Second Anglo-Maratha War 1803-05, Third Anglo-Maratha War 1817-19) leading to significant territorial gains.\n5.  **Policy of Paramountcy:** Initiated by Lord Hastings, this policy claimed the Company's authority was supreme, justifying annexation to protect its interests.\n6.  **Securing the North-West:** Driven by fear of Russian expansion, the Company fought a war with Afghanistan (1838-42), annexed Sind (1843), and Punjab (1849) after wars with the Sikh kingdom.\n7.  **Doctrine of Lapse:** Introduced by Lord Dalhousie, this policy annexed kingdoms if a ruler died without a male heir. Examples include Satara (1848), Sambalpur (1850), Udaipur (1852), Nagpur (1853), and Jhansi (1854).\n8.  **Pretext of Misgovernment:** Awadh was annexed in 1858 under the claim of freeing its people from the Nawab's 'misgovernment'."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.2.3", "6.7.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhat Happened to the Local Schools? \n\n Do you have any idea of how children were taught in pre-British times? Have you ever wondered whether they went to schools? And if there were schools, what happened to these under British rule? \n The report of William Adam \n In the 1830s, William Adam, a Scottish missionary, toured the districts of Bengal and Bihar. He had been asked by the Company to report on the progress of education in vernacular schools. The report Adam produced is interesting. \nAdam found that there were over 1 lakh pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar. These were small institutions with no more than 20 students each. But the total number of children being taught in these pathshalas was considerable \u2013 over 20 lakh. These institutions were set up by wealthy people, or the local community. At times they were started by a teacher (guru). \nThe system of education was flexible. Few things that you associate with schools today were present in the pathshalas at the time. There were no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table. In some places classes were held under a banyan tree, in other places in the corner of a village shop or temple, or at the guru\u2019s home. Fee depended on the income of parents: the rich had to pay more than the poor. Teaching was oral, and the guru decided what to teach, in accordance with the needs of the students. Students were not separated out into different classes: all of them sat together in one place. The guru interacted separately with groups of children with different levels of learning. \nAdam discovered that this flexible system was suited to local needs. For instance, classes were not held during harvest time when rural children often worked in the fields. The pathshala started once again when the crops had been cut and stored. This meant that even children of peasant families could study. \nNew routines, new rules \n Up to the mid-nineteenth century, the Company was concerned primarily with higher education. So it allowed the local pathshalas to function without much interference. After 1854 the Company decided to improve the system of vernacular education. It felt that this could be done by introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections. \nHow was this to be done? What measures did the Company undertake? It appointed a number of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable. Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination. Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline. \nPathshalas which accepted the new rules were supported through government grants. Those who were unwilling to work within the new system received no government support. Over time gurus who wanted to retain their independence found it difficult to compete with the government aided and regulated pathshalas. \nThe new rules and routines had another consequence. In the earlier system children from poor peasant families had been able to go to pathshalas, since the timetable was flexible. The discipline of the new system demanded regular attendance, even during harvest time when children of poor families had to work in the fields. Inability to attend school came to be seen as indiscipline, as evidence of the lack of desire to learn. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on William Adam's report, what were the key flexible features of the traditional pathshala system in Bengal and Bihar, and how did the Company's educational reforms after 1854 transform these features?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for two main points: the flexible features of traditional pathshalas as per William Adam's report and how the Company's reforms after 1854 changed them. \n\n1.  **Traditional Pathshalas (William Adam's report):** The text states that Adam found over 1 lakh pathshalas with a flexible system. Key features included: 'no fixed fee, no printed books, no separate school building, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no system of separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular time-table.' It also notes that 'Fee depended on the income of parents,' 'Teaching was oral,' 'the guru decided what to teach,' and 'classes were not held during harvest time' to suit local needs, allowing 'children of peasant families could study.'\n\n2.  **Company's Reforms (after 1854):** The text indicates that after 1854, the Company 'decided to improve the system of vernacular education' by 'introducing order within the system, imposing routines, establishing rules, ensuring regular inspections.' Specific measures included: 'appointed a number of government pandits,' 'Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable.' 'Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination.' Students 'were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline.' Pathshalas accepting these rules received 'government grants,' while others did not. This new system also meant 'regular attendance, even during harvest time,' which disadvantaged 'children from poor peasant families.'\n\n3.  **Transformation:** The reforms directly counteracted almost every flexible feature. Flexible fees became regular fees, no printed books became textbook-based learning, no annual exams became annual examinations, no regular timetable became a regular timetable, and flexible attendance (especially during harvest) became mandatory regular attendance.\n\nAnswer: According to William Adam's report, traditional pathshalas in Bengal and Bihar were characterized by a highly flexible system: there were no fixed fees, no printed books, no separate school buildings, no benches or chairs, no blackboards, no separate classes, no roll-call registers, no annual examinations, and no regular timetable. Fees varied based on parents' income, teaching was oral, and classes were often suspended during harvest time to accommodate rural children's work.\n\nAfter 1854, the Company's educational reforms fundamentally transformed these features. The new system introduced government pandits, required gurus to submit periodic reports and follow a regular timetable, mandated teaching based on textbooks, and implemented annual examinations. Students were required to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and adhere to new rules of discipline. Pathshalas that accepted these rules received government grants, while those that did not lost support, and the strict attendance requirements disadvantaged children from poor peasant families who previously benefited from the flexible schedule."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.7.2", "7.7.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMany of these new kings adopted high-sounding titles such as maharaja-adhiraja (great king, overlord of kings), tribhuvana-chakravartin (lord of the three worlds) and so on. However, in spite of such claims, they often shared power with their samantas as well as with associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas. \nIn each of these states, resources were obtained from the producers \u2013 that is, peasants, cattle-keepers, artisans \u2013 who were often persuaded or compelled to surrender part of what they produced. Sometimes these were claimed as \u201crent\u201d due to a lord who asserted that he owned the land. Revenue was also collected from traders. \nThe inscriptions of the Cholas who ruled in Tamil Nadu refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds of taxes. The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti, taken not in cash but in the form of forced labour, and kadamai, or land revenue. There were also taxes on thatching the house, the use of a ladder to climb palm trees, a cess on succession to family property, etc. \nThese resources were used to finance the king\u2019s establishment, as well as for the construction of temples and forts. They were also used to fight wars, which were in turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes. \nThe functionaries for collecting revenue were generally recruited from influential families, and positions were often hereditary. This was true about the army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the king held these positions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\n1 How, When and Where\n\nHow Important are Dates?\nThere was a time when historians were fascinated with dates. There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally, fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river. In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors contributed to the decline of Masulipatnam in the eighteenth century, and what new policy of the English East India Company influenced this decline?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that Masulipatnam 'lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century' because 'the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai)'. This move was driven by 'a new policy of the English East India Company' which dictated that 'it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles.' Therefore, the decline was due to the relocation of traders and the Company's shift to a policy requiring trade centers to integrate political, administrative, and commercial functions.\n\nAnswer: Masulipatnam declined in the eighteenth century because its merchants and prosperity were lost when the English East India Company's traders moved to new centers like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras. This relocation was part of a new Company policy that sought trade centers capable of combining political, administrative, and commercial roles, rather than just having connections to hinterland production centers."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.5", "7.6.10", "7.2.2", "8.1.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists. Perhaps some women and men may have been specialists. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSome towns like Ahmedabad (Gujarat) went on to become major commercial cities but others like Thanjavur shrank in size and importance over the centuries. Murshidabad (West Bengal) on the banks of the Bhagirathi, which rose to prominence as a centre for silks and became the capital of Bengal in 1704, declined in the course of the century as the weavers faced competition from cheap mill-made cloth from England. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts, crafts and production activities flourished in towns and villages. Over the centuries important political, social and economic developments had taken place. But social change was not the same everywhere, because different kinds of societies evolved differently. It is important to understand how, and why, this happened. \nIn large parts of the subcontinent, society was already divided according to the rules of varna. These rules, as prescribed by the Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers of large kingdoms. The difference between the high and low, and between the rich and poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans and the Mughals, this hierarchy between social classes grew further. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWhile many people lived in the cities, others living in the countryside grew crops and reared animals. These farmers and herders supplied food to crafts persons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We know from remains of plants that the Harappans grew wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed and mustard. \nA new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds. While real ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have not survived, toy models have been found. As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used. This means that water was stored and supplied to the fields when the plants were growing. \nThe Harappans reared cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available around settlements. However, in the dry summer months large herds of animals were probably taken to greater distances in search of grass and water. They also collected fruits like ber, caught fish and hunted wild animals like the antelope. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe rich, glossy colours of silk, as well as its smooth texture, make it a highly valued fabric in most societies. Making silk is a complicated process. Raw silk has to be extracted from the cocoons of silk worms, spun into thread and then woven into cloth. Techniques of making silk were first invented in China around 7000 years ago. While the methods remained a closely guarded secret for thousands of years, some people from China who went to distant lands on foot, horseback, and on camels, carried silk with them. The paths they followed came to be known as the Silk Route. \nSometimes, Chinese rulers sent gifts of silk to rulers in Iran and west Asia, and from there, the knowledge of silk spread further west. About 2000 years ago, wearing silk became the fashion amongst rulers and rich people in Rome. It was very expensive, as it had to be brought all the way from China, along dangerous roads, through mountains and deserts. People living along the route often demanded payments for allowing traders to pass through. \nLook at Map 6 (pages 84-85) which shows the Silk Route and its branches. Some kings tried to control large portions of the route. This was because they could benefit from taxes, tributes and gifts that were brought by traders travelling along the route. In return, they often protected the traders who passed through their kingdoms from attacks by robbers. \nThe best-known of the rulers who controlled the Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over central Asia and north-west India around 2000 years ago. Their two major centres of power were Peshawar and Mathura. Taxila was also included in their kingdom. During their rule, a branch of the Silk Route extended from Central Asia down to the seaports at the mouth of the river Indus, from where silk was shipped westwards to the Roman Empire. The Kushanas were amongst the earliest rulers of the subcontinent to issue gold coins. These were used by traders along the Silk Route. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What evidence is provided for early textile production in the Harappan civilization, and how does the later discussion of silk illustrate the complexities of textile trade, economic value, and the impact of competition on production centers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Early Textile Production (Harappan):** The text states that 'Cotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago.' Further evidence includes 'Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro,' and the discovery of 'spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience,' which 'were used to spin thread.' This collectively points to early textile manufacturing in the Harappan period. \n2.  **Silk Trade and Economic Value:** The text explains that 'Techniques of making silk were first invented in China around 7000 years ago' and that silk became 'a highly valued fabric in most societies' due to its qualities. Its trade led to the 'Silk Route,' where 'kings tried to control large portions of the route' to 'benefit from taxes, tributes and gifts.' The Kushanas, prominent rulers of the Silk Route, 'were amongst the earliest rulers of the subcontinent to issue gold coins,' which were 'used by traders along the Silk Route,' signifying the high economic value and organized trade. \n3.  **Impact of Competition and Decline:** The text illustrates the negative impact of competition with the example of 'Murshidabad (West Bengal),' a significant 'centre for silks.' This city 'declined in the course of the century as the weavers faced competition from cheap mill-made cloth from England,' demonstrating how external economic factors could lead to the decline of established textile production hubs.\n\nAnswer: The Harappan civilization shows evidence of early textile production, with cotton grown at Mehrgarh around 7000 years ago, actual pieces of cloth found at Mohenjodaro, and spindle whorls used for spinning thread. Later, silk illustrates complex textile trade dynamics: invented in China, it became a highly valued fabric traded along the Silk Route, where rulers like the Kushanas benefited from taxes and issued gold coins for trade.

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWorking Towards Change \n\n From the early nineteenth century, we find debates and discussions about social customs and practices taking on a new character. One important reason for this was the development of new forms of communication. For the first time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and pamphlets were printed. These were far cheaper and far more accessible than the manuscripts that you have read about in Class VII. Therefore ordinary people could read these, and many of them could also write and express their ideas in their own languages. All kinds of issues \u2013 social, political, economic and religious \u2013 could now be debated and discussed by men (and sometimes by women as well) in the new cities. The discussions could reach out to a wider public, and could become linked to movements for social change. \nThese debates were often initiated by Indian reformers and reform groups. One such reformer was Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833). He founded a reform association known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known as the Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. People such as Rammohun Roy are described as reformers because they felt that changes were necessary in society, and unjust practices needed to be done away with. They thought that the best way to ensure such changes was by persuading people to give up old practices and adopt a new way of life. \nRammohun Roy was keen to spread the knowledge of Western education in the country and bring about greater freedom and equality for women. He wrote about the way women were forced to bear the burden of domestic work, confined to the home and the kitchen, and not allowed to move out and become educated. \nChanging the lives of widows \n Rammohun Roy was particularly moved by the problems widows faced in their lives. He began a campaign against the practice of sati. Rammohun Roy was well versed in Sanskrit, Persian and several other Indian and Europeon languages. He tried to show through his writings that the practice of widow burning had no sanction in ancient texts. By the early nineteenth century, many British officials had also begun to criticise Indian traditions and customs. They were therefore more than willing to listen to Rammohun who was reputed to be a learned man. In 1829, sati was banned. \nThe strategy adopted by Rammohun was used by later reformers as well. Whenever they wished to challenge a practice that seemed harmful, they tried to find a verse or sentence in the ancient sacred texts that supported their point of view. They then suggested that the practice as it existed at present was against early tradition. \nFor instance, one of the most famous reformers, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, used the ancient texts to suggest that widows could remarry. His suggestion was adopted by British officials, and a law was passed in 1856 permitting widow remarriage. Those who were against the remarriage of widows opposed Vidyasagar, and even boycotted him. \nBy the second half of the nineteenth century, the movement in favour of widow remarriage spread to other parts of the country. In the Telugu-speaking areas of the Madras Presidency, Veerasalingam Pantulu formed an association for widow remarriage. Around the same time young intellectuals and reformers in Bombay pledged themselves to working for the same cause. In the north, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who founded the reform association called Arya Samaj, also supported widow remarriage. Yet, the number of widows who actually remarried remained low. Those who married were not easily accepted in society and conservative groups continued to oppose the new law. \nGirls begin going to school \n Many of the reformers felt that education for girls was necessary in order to improve the condition of women. Vidyasagar in Calcutta and many other reformers in Bombay set up schools for girls. When the first schools were opened in the mid-nineteenth century, many people were afraid of them. They feared that schools would take girls away from home, prevent them from doing their domestic duties. Moreover, girls had to travel through public places in order to reach school. Many people felt that this would have a corrupting influence on them. They felt that girls should stay away from public spaces. Therefore, throughout the nineteenth century, most educated women were taught at home by liberal fathers or husbands. Sometimes women taught themselves. Do you remember what you read about Rashsundari Debi in your book Social and Political Life last year? She was one of those who secretly learned to read and write in the flickering light of candles at night. \nIn the latter part of the century, schools for girls were established by the Arya Samaj in Punjab, and Jyotirao Phule in Maharashtra. In aristocratic Muslim households in North India, women learnt to read the Koran in Arabic. They were taught by women who came home to teach. Some reformers such as Mumtaz Ali reinterpreted verses from the Koran to argue for women\u2019s education. The first Urdu novels began to be written from the late nineteenth century. Amongst other things, these were meant to encourage women to read about religion and domestic management in a language they could understand. \nWomen write about women From the early twentieth century, Muslim women like the Begums of Bhopal played a notable role in promoting education among women. They founded a primary school for girls at Aligarh. Another remarkable woman, Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain started schools for Muslim girls in Patna and Calcutta. She was a fearless critic of conservative ideas, arguing that religious leaders of every faith accorded an inferior place to women. \nBy the 1880s, Indian women began to enter universities. Some of them trained to be doctors, some became teachers. Many women began to write and publish their critical views on the place of women in society. Tarabai Shinde, a woman educated at home at Poona, published a book, Stripurushtulna, (A Comparison between Women and Men), criticising the social differences between men and women. \nPandita Ramabai, a great scholar of Sanskrit, felt that Hinduism was oppressive towards women, and wrote a book about the miserable lives of upper-caste Hindu women. She founded a widows\u2019 home at Poona to provide shelter to widows who had been treated badly by their husbands\u2019 relatives. Here women were trained so that they could support themselves economically. \nNeedless to say, all this more than alarmed the orthodox. For instance, many Hindu nationalists felt that Hindu women were adopting Western ways and that this would corrupt Hindu culture and erode family values. Orthodox Muslims were also worried about the impact of these changes. \nAs you can see, by the end of the nineteenth century, women themselves were actively working for reform. They wrote books, edited magazines, founded schools and training centres, and set up women\u2019s associations. From the early twentieth century, they formed political pressure groups to push through laws for female suffrage (the right to vote) and better health care and education for women. Some of them joined various kinds of nationalist and socialist movements from the 1920s. \nIn the twentieth century, leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose lent their support to demands for greater equality and freedom for women. Nationalist leaders promised that there would be full suffrage for all men and women after Independence. However, till then they asked women to concentrate on the anti-British struggles. \nLaw against child marriage \n With the growth of women\u2019s organisations and writings on these issues, the momentum for reform gained strength. People challenged another established custom \u2013 that of child marriage. There were a number of Indian legislators in the Central Legislative Assembly who fought to make a law preventing child marriage. In 1929 the Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed without the kind of bitter debates and struggles that earlier laws had seen. According to the Act no man below the age of 18 and woman below the age of 16 could marry. Subsequently these limits were raised to 21 for men and 18 for women. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe kings and kingdoms you have been reading about could not have existed without the support of flourishing villages. While new tools and the system of transplantation (Chapter 6) increased production, irrigation was also used. Irrigation works that were built during this time included canals, wells, tanks, and artificial lakes. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did the East India Company evolve from a purely mercantile trading company into a significant administrative power in India, and what methods did the British administration use to document such historical developments?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text in the 'East India Company Comes East' section establishes the Company's initial mercantile nature, stating it acquired a charter in 1600 from Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the 'sole right to trade with the East' to 'buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices.'\n2. The text explains that competition with other European powers for Indian goods 'inevitably pushed up the prices,' reducing profits. This led the Company to 'eliminat[e] rival competitors' through 'fierce battles,' sinking ships, blockading routes, and fortifying trading posts, blurring the lines between trade and politics.\n3. In Bengal, the Company's first factory was set up in 1651. It began building a fort by 1698 and 'bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages.' It also 'persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free,' demonstrating its acquisition of administrative and political influence.\n4. The 'How trade led to battles' and 'The Battle of Plassey' sections detail escalating conflicts with the Nawabs of Bengal, who resisted the Company's demands and refusal to pay duties. The Battle of Plassey in 1757, facilitated by Mir Jafar's betrayal, marked the Company's 'first major victory' and allowed it to install puppet rulers, solidifying its military and political control.\n5. The text further states that the difficulties with 'puppet nawabs' led to their deposition. Ultimately, in 1765, the Mughal emperor 'appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal,' granting it 'vast revenue resources.' This allowed revenues to 'finance Company expenses,' 'maintain Company troops,' and 'meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices,' signifying its full administrative and financial control.\n6. For documentation, the 'How do We Know?' section states that the British believed 'the act of writing was important' and 'Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up,' creating an 'administrative culture of memos, notings and reports.'\n7. It specifies that 'record rooms attached to all administrative institutions' and 'Specialised institutions like archives and museums' were established for preservation. Documents were 'carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists' in the early 19th century and later 'printed' by the mid-19th century.\n8. Additionally, 'Surveys became important' for effective administration. This included 'detailed surveys... to map the entire country,' 'revenue surveys,' and 'Census operations... every ten years,' which recorded information on 'castes, religions and occupation,' along with other specialized surveys.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company evolved from a mercantile trading company, initially focused on buying and selling goods for profit, into a significant administrative power through a series of strategic political and military actions. Driven by competition, it began fortifying settlements and engaging in conflicts, eventually acquiring zamindari rights, securing duty-free trade, and winning the Battle of Plassey. This culminated in the Mughal emperor appointing the Company as the Diwan of Bengal in 1765, granting it control over vast revenue resources and solidifying its administrative authority. The British administration documented these historical developments through a meticulous system of written official records, including instructions, plans, policies, memos, and reports, which were preserved in record rooms, archives, and museums. These documents were initially copied by calligraphists and later printed. Furthermore, extensive surveys, such as revenue surveys and decennial Census operations, were conducted to gather detailed information about the country for effective governance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.6.2", "8.8.2", "6.9.2", "8.2.2", "8.1.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As they moved eastwards, they cleared forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new communities of peasants. \nThis coincided with the establishment of Mughal control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and functionaries received land and often set up mosques that served as centres for religious transformation in these areas. \nThe early settlers sought some order and assurance in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. These were provided by community leaders, who also functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People referred to them with affection and respect as pirs. \nPir : A Persian word meaning a spiritual guide. \nThis term included saints or Sufis and other religious personalities, daring colonisers and deified soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even animistic spirits. The cult of pirs became very popular and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal. \nAnimism : Attribution of living soul to plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena. \nBengal also witnessed a temple-building spree from the late fifteenth century, which culminated in the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapters 2 and 5) that temples and other religious structures were often built by individuals or groups who were becoming powerful \u2013 to both demonstrate their power and proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the support of several \u201clow\u201d social groups, such as the Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). The coming of the European trading companies created new economic opportunities; many families belonging to these social groups availed of these. As their social and economic position improved, they proclaimed their status through the construction of temples. When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, their images began to be housed in temples. The temples began to copy the double-roofed (dochala) or four-roofed (chauchala) structure of the thatched huts. (Remember the \u201cBangla dome\u201d in Chapter 5?) This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in temple architecture. \nIn the comparatively more complex four-roofed structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. Temples were usually built on a square platform. The interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, such decorations reached a high degree of excellence. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nNorthern Black Polished Ware (NBPW) NBPW is a hard, wheel made, metallic looking ware with a shiny black sur face. The potter used to expose the earthenware to very high temperature in his kiln which resulted in the blackening of its outer surface. A fine black slip was also applied on this, which gave the pottery a mirror-like shine \nFind Arikamedu (in Puducherry) on Map 7 (page 113), and read the box on Rome on page 96. Between 2200 and 1900 years ago, Arikamedu was a coastal settlement where ships unloaded goods from distant lands. A massive brick structure, which may have been a warehouse, was found at the site. Other finds include pottery from the Mediterranean region, such as amphorae (tall double-handled jars that contained liquids such as wine or oil) and stamped red-glazed pottery, known as Arretine Ware, which was named after a city in Italy. This was made by pressing wet clay into a stamped mould. There was yet another kind of pottery which was made locally, though Roman designs were used. Roman lamps, glassware and gems have also been found at the site. \nSmall tanks have been found that were probably dyeing vats, used to dye cloth. There is plenty of evidence for the making of beads from semi-precious stones and glass. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, how do both the archaeological finds at Arikamedu and the development of the Pir cult in Bengal demonstrate cultural interaction and adaptation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Arikamedu:** The text explicitly states that Arikamedu was a 'coastal settlement where ships unloaded goods from distant lands,' indicating cultural interaction through trade.

He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIn the early thirteenth century the control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns occupied by garrisons. The Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities and were therefore dependent upon trade, tribute or plunder for supplies. Controlling garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind from Delhi was extremely difficult. Rebellion, war, even bad weather could snap fragile communication routes. Delhi\u2019s authority was also challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness. The Sultanate barely survived these challenges. Its consolidation occurred during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq. \nHinterland - The lands adjacent to a city or port that supply it with goods and services. Garrison town - A fortified settlement, with soldiers. \nThe first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the hinterlands of the garrison towns. During these campaigns forests were cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab and huntergatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitat. These lands were given to peasants and agriculture was encouraged. New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade routes and to promote regional trade. \nThe second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate. Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (see Map 3) and culminated with Muhammad Tughluq. In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses and slaves and carried away precious metals. \nBy the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, 150 years after somewhat humble beginnings, the armies of the Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent. They had defeated rival armies and seized cities. The Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm. But how complete and effective was its control over such a vast territory? \nThe Masjid A mosque is called a masjid in Arabic, literally a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to Allah. In a \u201ccongregational mosque\u201d (masjid-i-jami or jama masjid) Muslims read their prayers (namaz) together. Members of the congregation choose the most respected, learned male as their leader (imam) for the rituals of prayer. He also delivers the sermon (khutba) during the Friday prayer. During prayer, Muslims stand facing Mecca. In India this is to the west. This is called the qibla. The Delhi Sultans built several mosques in cities all over the subcontinent. These demonstrated their claims to be protectors of Islam and Muslims. Mosques also helped to create the sense of a community of believers who shared a belief system and a code of conduct. It was necessary to reinforce this idea of a community because Muslims came from a variety of backgrounds. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThis was also the time when other scholars were at work.

Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThere were two major changes in agriculture around this time. One was the growing use of iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey soil could be turned over better than with a wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could be produced. Second, people began transplanting paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed on the ground, from which plants would sprout, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. This led to increased production, as many more plants survived. However, it was back breaking work. Generally, slave men and women, (dasas and dasis) and landless agricultural labourers (kammakaras) had to do this work. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the significant social transformations and scientific advancements described in the provided texts regarding ancient India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The social transformations are detailed in the first section.

At the same time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj. Because there were three \u201cparties\u201d in this longdrawn conflict, historians often describe it as the \u201ctripartite struggle\u201d. \nAs we will see (pp. 62-66), rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples. So, when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms, they often chose to target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich. You will read more about this in Chapter 5. \nOne of the best known of such rulers is Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. He ruled from 997 to 1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia, Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent. He raided the subcontinent almost every year \u2013 his targets were wealthy temples, including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni. \nSultan Mahmud was also interested in finding out more about the people he conquered, and entrusted a scholar named Al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent. This Arabic work, known as the Kitab ul-Hind, remains an important source for historians. He consulted Sanskrit scholars to prepare this account. \nOther kings who engaged in warfare included the Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They attempted to expand their control to the west and the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh. The best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very next year, in 1192. \nSultan - An Arabic term meaning ruler. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTake a look at Table 1 again. You will notice that after the Tughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra until 1526. By then, Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the entire south India had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals. This was also the period which saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the Afghans and the Rajputs. \nSome of the states established in this period were small but powerful and extremely well administered. Sher Shah Sur (1540-1545) started his career as the manager of a small territory for his uncle in Bihar and eventually challenged and defeated the Mughal emperor Humayun (1530-1540, 1555-1556). Sher Shah captured Delhi and established his own dynasty. Although the Sur dynasty ruled for only fifteen years (1540-1555), it introduced an administration that borrowed elements from Alauddin Khalji and made them more efficient. Sher Shah\u2019s administration became the model followed by the great emperor Akbar (1556-1605) when he consolidated the Mughal Empire. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the varying methods rulers used to demonstrate and consolidate their power, and how did these methods, particularly administrative and economic practices, affect wealth distribution across different social groups?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Demonstration and Consolidation of Power (Section 1 & 2):** Early rulers, such as those involved in the 'tripartite struggle' for Kanauj, demonstrated power through control of strategic territories. They also built large temples to display their resources and targeted wealthy temples during attacks, as exemplified by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, who used the wealth from raids (e.g., Somnath) to create a 'splendid capital city at Ghazni'. Later, Sher Shah Sur consolidated power through an efficient administration that became a 'model' for subsequent emperors like Akbar. This shows an evolution from territorial and military projection, often involving wealth extraction from religious sites, to sophisticated administrative efficiency. \n2.  **Impact on Wealth Distribution (Section 3):** The Mughal Empire's administrative and military efficiency led to 'great economic and commercial prosperity'. However, this wealth was distributed highly unequally. A small percentage of high-ranking mansabdars (5.6%) received a disproportionately large share (61.5%) of the empire's estimated revenue as salaries. While the expenditure by the elite benefited artisans and peasantry by creating demand, the 'scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan,' who often lived 'from hand to mouth.' In contrast, 'wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited.'\n3.  **Shifting Power and Wealth (Section 3):** As the Mughal emperor's authority declined, his former 'servants' emerged as 'powerful centres of power in the regions,' forming 'new dynasties' and consolidating 'independent political identities' in provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh, indicating a decentralization of wealth and power from the central empire to regional elites.\n\nAnswer: Rulers demonstrated and consolidated power through territorial control (e.g., Kanauj), military campaigns, and constructing grand temples, often targeting wealthy temples for resources (Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni used raid wealth for Ghazni). Later, efficient administration, like Sher Shah Sur's model, became crucial. Economically, the Mughal Empire experienced great prosperity, but wealth was highly unequal; a small fraction of high-ranking mansabdars received the majority of the revenue. While imperial expenditure benefited some artisans and peasants, the extensive revenue collection left primary producers with little for investment, leading to poverty for the poorest, while wealthier groups like merchants and bankers prospered. As imperial authority declined, former Mughal servants established independent regional dynasties, decentralizing power and wealth."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.4", "7.3.5", "7.4.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The area around Pataliputra was under the direct control of the emperor. This meant that officials were appointed to collect taxes from farmers, herders, crafts persons and traders, who lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials also punished those who disobeyed the ruler\u2019s orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a watch on the officials. And of course the emperor supervised them all, with the help of members of the royal family, and senior ministers. \nThere were other areas or provinces. Each of these was ruled from a provincial capital such as Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were often sent as governors, local customs and rules were probably followed. \nBesides, there were vast areas between these centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads and rivers, which were important for transport, and to collect whatever resources were available as tax and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us that the north-west was important for blankets, and south India for its gold and precious stones. It is possible that these resources were collected as tribute. \nThere were also the forested regions. People living in these areas were more or less independent, but may have been expected to provide elephants, timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nContemporary historians and travellers give very scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Company Fights Back \n\n Unnerved by the scale of the upheaval, the Company decided to repress the revolt with all its might. It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum Zinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in November 1862. \nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the rebellion died down after that. People continued to resist and battle the British. The British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. Lucknow was taken in March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate awaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, chose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on all sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India and continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of many tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried and killed in April 1859. \nJust as victories against the British had earlier encouraged rebellion, the defeat of rebel forces encouraged desertions. The British also tried their best to win back the loyalty of the people. They announced rewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British, and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied. Nevertheless, hundreds of sepoys, rebels, nawabs and rajas were tried and hanged. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather than janas. The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red. One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and geometric patterns. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere were two major changes in agriculture around this time.

Other provinces, like those ruled from Taxila or Ujjain, had some central control from Pataliputra, with royal princes often serving as governors, but local customs and rules were likely followed. In the vast areas between these centers, the Mauryas aimed to control roads and rivers for transport and collected resources such as blankets from the north-west and gold and precious stones from south India as tax and tribute.

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nNomadic pastoralists moved over long distances with their animals. They lived on milk and other pastoral products. They also exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with settled agriculturists for grain, cloth, utensils and other products. They bought and sold these goods as they moved from one place to another, transporting them on their animals. \nNomads and itinerant groups Nomads are wandering people. Many of them are pastoralists who roam from one pasture to another with their flocks and herds. Similarly, itinerant groups, such as craftspersons, pedlars and entertainers travel from place to place practising their different occupations. Both nomads and itinerant groups often visit the same places every year. \nThe Banjaras were the most important tradernomads. Their caravan was called tanda. Sultan Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal army during military campaigns. With a large army there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain. \nPeter Mundy, an English trader who came to India during the early seventeenth century, has described the Banjaras: In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with14,000 oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and rice ... These Banjaras carry their household \u2013 wives and children \u2013 along with them. One tanda consists of many families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen.

Mahatma Gandhi along with other nationalists reasoned that it was sinful to tax salt since it is such an essential item of our food. The Salt March related the general desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by everybody, and thus did not divide the rich and the poor. \nGandhiji and his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt.

In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n10 India After Independence \n\n A New and Divided Nation \n\n When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges. As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThrough the Eyes of the People \n\n To get a glimpse of what people were thinking those days about British rule, study Sources 1 and 2. \n The list of eighty-four rules \n Given here are excerpts from the book Majha Pravaas, written by Vishnubhatt Godse, a Brahman from a village in Maharashtra. He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the immediate and longer-term challenges India faced at the time of its independence in August 1947?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section, titled '10 India After Independence', directly addresses the challenges faced by India when it became independent in August 1947.

Here, these rough blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. And then these had to be placed in precisely the right position. \nKings and queens probably spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts persons who worked to build these splendid structures.

So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory.

The Vikram Samvat has also been adopted alongside the Gregorian calendar as the national calendar by independent India. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather than janas. The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red. One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and geometric patterns. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the architectural features of Shah Jahan's audience halls and his court in the Red Fort emphasize the king's divine representation and the nature of royal justice?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that Shah Jahan's audience halls were specifically constructed to resemble a mosque, and the pedestal for his throne was often referred to as the qibla, the direction Muslims face during prayer.

It had to be fought for. In 1930, Gandhiji declared that he would lead a march to break the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi along with other nationalists reasoned that it was sinful to tax salt since it is such an essential item of our food. The Salt March related the general desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by everybody, and thus did not divide the rich and the poor. \nGandhiji and his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt. Peasants, tribals and women participated in large numbers. A business federation published a pamphlet on the salt issue. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were sent to jail. \nThe combined struggles of the Indian people bore fruit when the Government of India Act of 1935 prescribed provincial autonomy and the government announced elections to the provincial legislatures in 1937. The Congress formed governments in 7 out of 11 provinces. \nIn September 1939, after two years of Congress rule in the provinces, the Second World War broke out. Critical of Hitler, Congress leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to concede the demand. The Congress ministries resigned in protest. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhile Magadha became a powerful kingdom, Vajji, with its capital at Vaishali (Bihar), was under a different form of government, known as gana or sangha. \nIn a gana or a sangha there were not one, but many rulers. Sometimes, even when thousands of men ruled together, each one was known as a raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through discussion and debate. For example, if they were attacked by an enemy, they met to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. However, women, dasas and kammakaras could not participate in these assemblies. \nBoth the Buddha and Mahavira (about whom you will read in Chapter 7) belonged to ganas or sanghas. Some of the most vivid descriptions of life in the sanghas can be found in Buddhist books. \nRajas of powerful kingdoms tried to conquer the sanghas. Nevertheless, these lasted for a very long time, till about 1500 years ago, when the last of the ganas or sanghas were conquered by the Gupta rulers, about whom you will read in Chapter 11. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Mughals were descendants of two great lineages of rulers. From their mother\u2019s side they were descendants of Genghis Khan (died 1227), the Mongol ruler who ruled over parts of China and Central Asia. From their father\u2019s side they were the successors of Timur (died 1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and modern-day Turkey. However, the Mughals did not like to be called Mughal or Mongol. This was because Genghis Khan\u2019s memory was associated with the massacre of innumerable people. It was also linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol competitors. On the other hand, the Mughals were proud of their Timurid ancestry, not least of all because their great ancestor had captured Delhi in 1398. They celebrated their genealogy pictorially, each ruler getting a picture made of Timur and himself. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nPaper has become a part of our daily lives. The books we read are printed on paper, and we use paper for writing. Paper was invented in China about 1900 years ago, by a man named Cai Lun. He beat plant fibres, cloth, rope and the bark of trees, soaked these in water, and then pressed, drained and dried the pulp to create paper. Even today, hand made paper is made through a similar process. \nThe technique of making paper was a closely guarded secret for centuries. It reached Korea about 1400 years ago, and spread to Japan soon after. It was known in Baghdad about 1800 years ago. From Baghdad it spread to Europe, Africa, and other parts of Asia including the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka \n Women from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement. During the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed to women\u2019s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the participation of women in the national movement, specifically during the Salt Satyagraha, differ from their role in the assemblies of a gana or sangha form of government?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section, 'Women in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka,' indicates that women participated significantly in the national movement, fighting for their right to do so, as seen when Sarojini Naidu persuaded Mahatma Gandhi to allow women to join the Salt Satyagraha.

Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts.

Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHow do We Know? \n\n What sources do historians use in writing about the last 250 years of Indian history?\nAdministration produces records\nOne important source is the official records of the British administration. The British believed that the act of writing was important. Every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation had to be clearly written up. Once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of memos, notings and reports. \nThe British also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved. So they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar\u2019s office, the collectorate, the commissioner\u2019s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts \u2013 all had their record rooms. Specialised institutions like archives and museums were also established to preserve important records. \nLetters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to another in the early years of the nineteenth century can still be read in the archives. You can also study the notes and reports that district officials prepared, or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to provincial administrators. \nIn the early years of the nineteenth century these documents were carefully copied out and beautifully written by calligraphists \u2013 that is, by those who specialised in the art of beautiful writing. By the middle of the nineteenth century, with the spread of printing, multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department. \nSurveys become important \n The practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration. The British believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administered. \nBy the early nineteenth century detailed surveys were being carried out to map the entire country. In the villages, revenue surveys were conducted. The effort was to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories, and the cropping pattern \u2013 all the facts seen as necessary to know about to administer the region. From the end of the nineteenth century, Census operations were held every ten years. These prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation. There were many other surveys \u2013 botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archaeological surveys, anthropological surveys, forest surveys. \nWhat official records do not tell \n From this vast corpus of records we can get to know a lot, but we must remember that these are official records. They tell us what the officials thought, what they were interested in, and what they wished to preserve for posterity. These records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. \nFor that we need to look elsewhere. When we begin to search for these other sources we find them in plenty, though they are more difficult to get than official records. We have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular booklets that were sold in the local bazaars. As printing spread, newspapers were published and issues were debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings. \nAll these sources, however, were produced by those who were literate. From these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants, the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets. Getting to know their lives is a more difficult task. Yet this can be done, if we make a little bit of effort. When you read this book you will see how this can be done. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nProvincial autonomy - Capacity of the provinces to make relatively independent decisions while remaining within a federation. \nThe March to Dandi \n Purna Swaraj would never come on its own.

First, I will identify the administrative practices of early kingdoms from the section 'As in the case of earlier kings...'. This section states that land revenue was important, the village was the basic unit of administration, and kings adopted steps to win support of powerful men. These steps included making some administrative posts hereditary (e.g., a son succeeding his father, like Harishena), allowing one person to hold multiple offices (e.g., Harishena as maha-danda-nayaka, kumar-amatya, and sandhi-vigrahika), and involving important local men such as the nagarashreshthi, sarthavaha, prathama-kulika, and head of the kayasthas in local administration. \n2. Next, I will identify the record-keeping and information-gathering methods of the British administration from the section 'How do We Know?'. This text explains that the British believed in the importance of writing, which led to an administrative culture of memos, notings, and reports. They carefully preserved important documents in record rooms, archives, and museums. These documents were initially copied by calligraphists and later printed. \n3. The British also extensively used surveying to know the country for effective administration. This included detailed revenue surveys to understand topography, soil quality, flora, fauna, local histories, and cropping patterns. Census operations were conducted every ten years, recording information on population, castes, religions, and occupations. Other specialized surveys like botanical, zoological, archaeological, anthropological, and forest surveys were also common.\n4. Finally, I will contrast these two sets of practices. The early kingdoms focused on land revenue, village-level administration, and securing powerful individuals' loyalty through hereditary posts and local influence, without explicit mention of systematic written records or widespread surveying. In contrast, the British administration employed a highly systematic, written, and documented approach to governance, emphasizing detailed record-keeping, preservation, and comprehensive surveying for data collection and control.\n\nAnswer: The administrative practices of early kingdoms focused on land revenue as important, with the village serving as the basic unit of administration. Kings took steps to secure the support of powerful men, which included making some administrative posts hereditary (where sons succeeded fathers) and allowing one person to hold multiple offices simultaneously. Additionally, influential local figures such as the chief banker or merchant (nagarashreshthi), leader of merchant caravans (sarthavaha), chief craftsman (prathama-kulika), and head of scribes (kayasthas) likely had a say in local administration.\n\nIn contrast, the British administration employed highly systematic record-keeping and information-gathering methods. They believed that writing was crucial, which fostered an administrative culture of memos, notings, and reports. All important documents and letters were meticulously preserved in dedicated record rooms, archives, and museums.

Let\u2019s travel in our imagination to Thanjavur, the capital of the Cholas, as it was a thousand years ago. The perennial river Kaveri flows near this beautiful town. One hears the bells of the Rajarajeshvara temple built by King Rajaraja Chola. The towns people are all praise for its architect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan who has proudly carved his name on the temple wall. Inside is a massive Shiva linga. \nBesides the temple, there are palaces with mandapas or pavilions. Kings hold court in these mandapas, issuing orders to their subordinates. There are also barracks for the army. \nThe town is bustling with markets selling grain, spices, cloth and jewellery. Water supply for the town comes from wells and tanks. The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses. Some distance away at Svamimalai, the sthapatis or sculptors are making exquisite bronze idols and tall, ornamental bell metal lamps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nRuling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent with such a diversity of people and cultures was an extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplish in the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLarge states like those of the Cholas (Chapter 2), Tughluqs (Chapter 3) or Mughals (Chapter 4) encompassed many regions. A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned.

This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIf you look at Maps 1 and 2 closely, you will see something significant happening in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century. Notice how the boundaries of the Mughal Empire were reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent kingdoms. By 1765, notice how another power, the British, had successfully grabbed major chunks of territory in eastern India. What these maps tell us is that political conditions in eighteenthcentury India changed quite dramatically and within a relatively short span of time. \nIn this chapter we will read about the emergence of new political groups in the subcontinent during the first half of the eighteenth century \u2013 roughly from 1707, when Aurangzeb died, till the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did large, pan-regional empires, such as the Cholas and Mughals, interact with and influence the regional characteristics and languages across the Indian subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The question asks about the influence of large, pan-regional empires like the Cholas and Mughals on regional characteristics and languages.\n2. Section 3 states that dynasties like the Cholas and Mughals were able to build 'pan-regional' empires that spanned diverse regions.\n3. This section explains that 'years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions,' resulting in 'the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language.'\n4. Specifically concerning language, Section 3 references the poet Amir Khusrau's observation in 1318 that 'there was a different language in every region of this land,' which included various regional languages, contrasting them with Sanskrit which 'did not belong to any region.' This indicates that regional languages maintained their distinctiveness even under pan-regional rule.\n5. Section 4 further describes the Mughal influence, noting that they 'imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy,' which aligns with the impact on 'governance' mentioned in Section 3.\n6. Ultimately, Section 3 summarizes that 'These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness.'\n\nAnswer: Large pan-regional empires like the Cholas and Mughals significantly altered the character of the regions they encompassed through years of imperial rule. This led to the emergence of both distinct and shared traditions in governance, economic management, elite cultures, and language. For instance, the Mughals imposed structures of administration and governance that left a lasting political legacy. However, regions retained their distinctiveness, as evidenced by the persistence of numerous regional languages, which Amir Khusrau noted in 1318, distinguishing them from Sanskrit which was not regional. Thus, regions felt the impact of pan-regional integration without losing their unique characteristics."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.2", "6.7.1", "7.1.5", "7.4.1", "7.10.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nIf somebody asks you the date, you will probably mention the day, month and year, 2000 and something.

All dates before the birth of Christ are counted backwards and usually have the letters BC (Before Christ) added on. In this book, we will refer to dates going back from the present, using 2000 as our starting point. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Kabir's teachings regarding social structure and religious practices contrast with the societal developments observed during the broader period between 700 and 1750, as described in the provided texts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text section describes the period between 700 and 1750 as one where society became more differentiated, with people grouped into 'jatis or sub-castes' based on their backgrounds and occupations.

The third text section introduces Kabir, who lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries (a period falling within 700-1750). This section states that Kabir's teachings were based on a 'vehement rejection of the major religious traditions.'

Sal \u2013 A tree. Mahua \u2013 A flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol. Bewar \u2013 A term used in Madhya Pradesh for shifting cultivation. \nHow Did Tribal Groups Live? \n\n By the nineteenth century, tribal people in different parts of India were involved in a variety of activities. Some were jhum cultivators \n Some of them practised jhum cultivation, that is, shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the ground, and burnt the vegetation on the land to clear it for cultivation. They spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash, to fertilise the soil. They used the axe to cut trees and the hoe to scratch the soil in order to prepare it for cultivation. They broadcast the seeds, that is, scattered the seeds on the field instead of ploughing the land and sowing the seeds. Once the crop was ready and harvested, they moved to another field. A field that had been cultivated once was left fallow for several years, Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India. The lives of these tribal people depended on free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests for growing their crops. That is the only way they could practise shifting cultivation. \nSome were hunters and gatherers \n In many regions tribal groups lived by hunting animals and gathering forest produce. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes, and sold forest produce in the local markets. The local weavers and leather workers turned to the Khonds when they needed supplies of kusum and palash flowers to colour their clothes and leather. \nFrom where did these forest people get their supplies of rice and other grains? At times they exchanged goods \u2013 getting what they needed in return for their valuable forest produce. At other times they bought goods with the small amount of earnings they had. Some of them did odd jobs in the villages, carrying loads or building roads, while others laboured in the fields of peasants and farmers. When supplies of forest produce shrank, tribal people had to increasingly wander around in search of work as labourers. But many of them \u2013 like the Baigas of central India \u2013 were reluctant to do work for others. The Baigas saw themselves as people of the forest, who could only live on the produce of the forest. It was below the dignity of a Baiga to become a labourer. \nTribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale, and sold the goods at high prices. Moneylenders gave loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was usually very high. So for the tribals, market and commerce often meant debt and poverty. They therefore came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery. \nSome herded animals \n Many tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. When the grass in one place was exhausted, they moved to another area. The Van Gujjars of the Punjab hills and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds, and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats. You will read more about them in your history book next year. \nSome took to settled cultivation \n Even before the nineteenth century, many from within the tribal groups had begun settling down, and cultivating their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough, and gradually got rights over the land they lived on. In many cases, like the Mundas of Chottanagpur, the land belonged to the clan as a whole. All members of the clan were regarded as descendants of the original settlers, who had first cleared the land. Therefore, all of them had rights on the land. Very often some people within the clan acquired more power than others, some became chiefs and others followers. Powerful men often rented out their land instead of cultivating it themselves. British officials saw settled tribal groups like the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than huntergatherers or shifting cultivators. Those who lived in the forests were considered to be wild and savage: they needed to be settled and civilised. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n5 When People Rebel \n 1857 and After \n\n Policies and the People \n\n Nawabs lose their power Since the mid-eighteenth century, nawabs and rajas had seen their power erode. They had gradually lost their authority and honour. Residents had been stationed in many courts, the freedom of the rulers reduced, their armed forces disbanded, and their revenues and territories taken away by stages. \nMany ruling families tried to negotiate with the Company to protect their interests. For example, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi wanted the Company to recognise her adopted son as the heir to the kingdom after the death of her husband. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II, pleaded that he be given his father\u2019s pension when the latter died. However, the Company, confident of its superiority and military powers, turned down these pleas. \nAwadh was one of the last territories to be annexed. In 1801, a subsidiary alliance was imposed on Awadh, and in 1856 it was taken over. Governor -General Dalhousie declared that the territory was being misgoverned and British rule was needed to ensure proper administration. \nThe Company even began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the Company. In 1849, Gover nor -General Dalhousie announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king would be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another place in Delhi to reside in. In 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal king and after his death none of his descendants would be recognised as kings \u2013 they would just be called princes. \nThe peasants and the sepoys \n In the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection. Many failed to pay back their loans to the moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations. \nThe Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company also had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service. Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs. Did you know that in those days many people in the country believed that if they crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste? So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to Burma by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to go by the land route. They were severely punished, and since the issue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the Company\u2019s army had to agree to serve overseas if required. \nSepoys also reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of them were peasants and had families living in the villages. So the anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys. \nResponses to reforms \n The British believed that Indian society had to be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage of widows. English-language education was actively promoted. After 1830, the Company allowed Christian missionaries to function freely in its domain and even own land and property. In 1850, a new law was passed to make conversion to Christianity easier. This law allowed an Indian who had converted to Christianity to inherit the property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to feel that the British were destroying their religion, their social customs and their traditional way of life. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the distinct reasons for discontent among various social groups, including rulers, peasants, sepoys, and tribal communities?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Rulers (Nawabs, Rajas, and Mughals):** The first text section, under 'Nawabs lose their power', explicitly states that nawabs and rajas 'had seen their power erode', 'lost their authority and honour', had their 'freedom...reduced', 'armed forces disbanded', and 'revenues and territories taken away'. Specific examples include Rani Lakshmibai's request for her adopted son to be recognized as heir and Nana Saheb's plea for his father\u2019s pension, both of which were 'turned down'. For the Mughals, the Company 'began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end' by removing the king's name from coins, planning to shift the king's family out of the Red Fort, and declaring Bahadur Shah Zafar as the last Mughal king, with descendants only recognized as princes. Awadh was also annexed under the pretext of 'misgoverned'.\n2.  **Peasants:** The first text section, under 'The peasants and the sepoys', states that peasants 'resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection'. Many 'failed to pay back their loans to the moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations'.\n3.  **Sepoys:** The same section notes that Indian sepoys were 'unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service'. Furthermore, 'Some of the new rules...violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs', such as the order to go to Burma by sea route in 1824 and the 1856 law requiring overseas service, which many believed would lead to losing their religion and caste. The text also mentions that the 'anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys' because many were peasants with families in villages.\n4.  **Tribal Communities:** The second text section, 'How Did Tribal Groups Live?', highlights their dependence on 'traders and moneylenders'. Traders 'sold the goods at high prices' and moneylenders charged 'very high' interest on loans, leading to 'debt and poverty'. Consequently, tribals 'came to see the moneylender and trader as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery'. Additionally, the British view of them as 'wild and savage' who 'needed to be settled and civilised' implies a threat to their traditional ways of life, such as jhum cultivation which depended on 'free movement within forests and on being able to use the land and forests'.\n\nAnswer: Rulers experienced a loss of power, authority, honor, and territory, with their pleas and succession rights denied by the Company. Peasants resented high taxes, rigid revenue collection, and lost their ancestral lands due to debt. Sepoys were discontent with their pay, allowances, conditions of service, and new rules that violated their religious beliefs, such as mandatory overseas service. Tribal communities suffered from debt and poverty due to high prices from traders and exorbitant interest rates from moneylenders, whom they viewed as 'evil outsiders,' and faced threats to their traditional way of life from British officials who deemed them 'wild and savage' and sought to 'civilise' them."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.5.1", "8.4.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Take a look at Table 1 again and identify the five dynasties that together made the Delhi Sultanate. \nThe rulers of Delhi - Table 1 - RAJPUT DYNASTIES : Tomaras Early twelfth century-1165, Ananga Pala 1130-1145, Chauhans 1165-1192, Prithviraj Chauhan 1175-1192 - EARLY TURKISH RULERS 1206-1290 : Qutbuddin Aybak 1206-1210, Shamsuddin Iltutmish 1210-1236, Raziyya 1236-1240, Ghiyasuddin Balban 1266-1287 - KHALJI DYNASTY 1290-1320 : Jalaluddin Khalji 1290-1296, Alauddin Khalji 1296-1316 - TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 1320-1414 : Ghiyasuddin Tughluq 1320-1324, Muhammad Tughluq 1324-1351, Firuz Shah Tughluq 1351-1388 - SAYYID DYNASTY 1414-1451 : Khizr Khan 1414-1421 - LODI DYNASTY 1451-1526 : Bahlul Lodi 1451-1489 \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nSome of the best\u2013known epics were written during this period. Epics are grand, long compositions, about heroic men and women, and include stories about gods. \nA famous Tamil epic, the Silappadikaram, was composed by a poet named Ilango, around 1800 years ago. It is the story of a merchant named Kovalan, who lived in Puhar and fell in love with a courtesan named Madhavi, neglecting his wife Kannagi. Later, he and Kannagi left Puhar and went to Madurai, where he was wrongly accused of theft by the court jeweller of the Pandya king. The king sentenced Kovalan to death. Kannagi, who still loved him, was full of grief and anger at this injustice, and destroyed the entire city of Madurai. \nAnother Tamil epic, the Manimekalai was composed by Sattanar around 1400 years ago. This describes the story of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi. These beautiful compositions were lost to scholars for many centuries, till their manuscripts were rediscovered, about a hundred years ago. \nOther writers, such as Kalidasa, (about whom you read in Chapter 11) wrote in Sanskrit. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nLarge states like those of the Cholas (Chapter 2), Tughluqs (Chapter 3) or Mughals (Chapter 4) encompassed many regions. A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned.

It first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were later defeated by the Chauhans.\n2.  **Commercial Significance**: Under the Tomaras and Chauhans, Delhi became an \"important commercial centre.\" Rich Jaina merchants lived there, and coins minted in Delhi, called 'dehliwal', had a wide circulation.\n3.  **Transformation to Pan-regional Capital**: Delhi's transformation into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent began with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the early thirteenth century. The text lists the five dynasties that made up the Delhi Sultanate: Early Turkish Rulers, Khalji, Tughluq, Sayyid, and Lodi.\n4.  **Pan-regional Rule Claims**: The text mentions that large states like the Tughluqs (part of the Delhi Sultanate) encompassed many regions. Specifically, a Sanskrit prashasti praised Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287), claiming he ruled a vast empire from Bengal in the east to Ghazni in Afghanistan in the west, and included all of south India, demonstrating the ambition for pan-regional control from Delhi.\n5.  **Linguistic Diversity (Amir Khusrau's Observations)**: In 1318, during the Tughluq Dynasty (a period of Delhi-centered pan-regional rule), the poet Amir Khusrau noted that \"there was a different language in every region of this land,\" listing languages like Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Telangani, Gujari, Ma\u2018bari, Gauri, Awadhi, and Hindawi. He also pointed out that Sanskrit \"did not belong to any region\" and was not known by \"common people.\"\n6.  **Synthesis of Delhi's Development and Regional Distinctiveness**: While Delhi rose to become the political and commercial capital of powerful pan-regional empires like the Delhi Sultanate, Amir Khusrau's contemporary observations reveal that significant linguistic diversity persisted across the various regions of the subcontinent. This illustrates that despite efforts at political integration by central powers like the Delhi Sultanate, the cultural and linguistic distinctiveness of the regions endured, reinforcing the idea stated in the text that regions \"felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness.\"\n\nAnswer: Delhi emerged as a significant city in the twelfth century, first as a capital under the Tomara Rajputs and Chauhans, developing into an important commercial center where 'dehliwal' coins were widely circulated. Its transformation into a capital controlling vast areas of the subcontinent began with the Delhi Sultanate in the early thirteenth century, encompassing several dynasties and leading to claims of pan-regional rule by figures like Ghiyasuddin Balban. However, despite this political centralization, the poet Amir Khusrau's observations in 1318, during the Tughluq Dynasty, highlighted the enduring regional distinctiveness by noting 'a different language in every region of this land,' contrasting with Sanskrit which was not a common, regional language. This demonstrates that even as Delhi became the hub of pan-regional empires, diverse regional linguistic identities persisted throughout the subcontinent."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.12.6", "6.10.9", "7.1.1", "7.1.5", "7.3.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

To achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation.

The text states that 'Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver.' It also mentions 'spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience' and 'pots with beautiful black designs.'\n\nNext, I will list the purposes for which these materials were used. According to the text, 'Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels.' 'Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels.' 'Harappans also made seals out of stone' and 'beads, weights, and blades' were striking finds, likely made from stone. Spindle whorls were 'used to spin thread.'\n\nFinally, I will identify indications of specialized labor. The text explicitly states, 'Many of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists.' It defines a 'specialist' as 'a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals.' The text further supports this by referring to an illustration (not provided here, but mentioned in the text) of a 'well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown,' concluding 'This must have been the work of an expert crafts person.' The discovery of spindle whorls also implies specialized knowledge in textile production (spinning thread). The second text section discusses religious groups and is not relevant to this question about Harappan materials and labor.\n\nAnswer: The Harappans utilized a diverse array of materials including stone, shell, copper, bronze, gold, silver, terracotta, and faience. Copper and bronze were fashioned into tools, weapons, ornaments, and vessels, while gold and silver were used for ornaments and vessels. Stone was used for seals, beads, weights, and blades, and terracotta and faience were used for spindle whorls to spin thread. The presence of specialized labor is strongly indicated by the text, which defines specialists as individuals trained for specific tasks like cutting stone, polishing beads, or carving seals. The intricate craftsmanship, such as well-carved faces and carefully shown beards (as referenced in the text), points to the work of expert craftspersons, suggesting that not everybody was a specialist but rather certain individuals possessed advanced skills in particular trades."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.5", "7.8.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

By the late eighteenth century the Company was trying its best to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo. In the century and a half that followed, the British persuaded or forced cultivators in various parts of India to produce other crops: jute in Bengal, tea in Assam, sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), wheat in Punjab, cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab, rice in Madras. How was this done? The British used a variety of methods to expand the cultivation of crops that they needed. Let us take a closer look at the story of one such crop, one such method of production. \nDoes colour have a history? \n Figs. 5 and 6 are two images of cotton prints. The image on the left (Fig. 5) shows a kalamkari print created by weavers of Andhra Pradesh in India. On the right is a floral cotton print designed and produced by William Morris, a famous poet and artist of nineteenth-century Britain. There is one thing common in the two prints: both use a rich blue colour \u2013 commonly called indigo. Do you know how this colour was produced? The blue that you see in these prints was produced from a plant called indigo. It is likely that the blue dye used in the Morris prints in nineteenth-century Britain was manufactured from indigo plants cultivated in India. For India was the biggest supplier of indigo in the world at that time. \nPlantation \u2013 A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. \nWhy the demand for Indian indigo? \n The indigo plant grows primarily in the tropics. By the thirteenth century Indian indigo was being used by cloth manufacturers in Italy, France and Britain to dye cloth. However, only small amounts of Indian indigo reached the European market and its price was very high. European cloth manufacturers therefore had to depend on another plant called woad to make violet and blue dyes. Being a plant of the temperate zones, woad was more easily available in Europe. It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain. Worried by the competition from indigo, woad producers in Europe pressurised their governments to ban the import of indigo. \nCloth dyers, however, preferred indigo as a dye. Indigo produced a rich blue colour, whereas the dye from woad was pale and dull. By the seventeenth century, European cloth producers persuaded their governments to relax the ban on indigo import. The French began cultivating indigo in St Domingue in the Caribbean islands, the Portuguese in Brazil, the English in Jamaica, and the Spanish in Venezuela. Indigo plantations also came up in many parts of North America. \nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. Britain began to industrialise, and its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed for a variety of reasons. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. From where could this indigo be procured? \nBritain turns to India \n Faced with the rising demand for indigo in Europe, the Company in India looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation. From the last decades of the eighteenth century indigo cultivation in Bengal expanded rapidly and Bengal indigo came to dominate the world market. In 1788 only about 30 per cent of the indigo imported into Britain was from India. By 1810, the proportion had gone up to 95 per cent. \nAs the indigo trade grew, commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits, numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. \nHow was indigo cultivated? There were two main systems of indigo cultivation \u2013 nij and ryoti. Within the system of nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. \nThe problem with nij cultivation \n The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Only small plots scattered over the landscape could be acquired. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. Where could they get such land from? They attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory, and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension. Nor was labour easy to mobilise. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation. \nSlave \u2013 A person who is owned by someone else \u2013 the slave owner. A slave has no freedom and is compelled to work for the master. \n Bigha \u2013 A unit of measurement of land. Before British rule, the size of this area varied. In Bengal the British standardised it to about one-third of an acre. \nNij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. One bigha of indigo cultivation required two ploughs. This meant that a planter with 1,000 bighas would need 2,000 ploughs. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be easily got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them. Till the late nineteenth century, planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation. Less than 25 per cent of the land producing indigo was under this system. The rest was under an alternative mode of cultivation \u2013 the ryoti system. \nIndigo on the land of ryots \n Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the ryots to sign a contract, an agreement (satta). At times they pressurised the village headmen to sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25 per cent of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. \nWhen the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot, and the cycle started all over again. Peasants who were initially tempted by the loans soon realised how harsh the system was. The price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle of loans never ended. There were other problems too. The planters usually insisted that indigo be cultivated on the best soils in which peasants preferred to cultivate rice. Indigo, moreover, had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be sown with rice. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe last and 24th tirthankara of the Jainas, Vardhamana Mahavira, also spread his message around this time, i.e. 2500 years ago. He was a kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that was part of the Vajji sangha, about which you read in Chapter 6. At the age of thirty, he left home and went to live in a forest. For twelve years he led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment. \nHe taught a simple doctrine: men and women who wished to know the truth must leave their homes. They must follow very strictly the rules of ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living beings. \u201cAll beings,\u201d said Mahavira \u201clong to live. To all things life is dear.\u201d Ordinary people could understand the teachings of Mahavira and his followers, because they used Prakrit. There were several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of the country, and named after the regions in which they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken in Magadha was known as Magadhi. \nFollowers of Mahavira, who were known as Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and were especially asked not to steal. Also, they had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up everything, including their clothes. \nIt was very difficult for most men and women to follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands left their homes to learn and teach this new way of life. Many more remained behind and supported those who became monks and nuns, providing them with food. \nJainism was supported mainly by traders. Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and his followers were transmitted orally for several centuries. They were written down in the form in which they are presently available at a place called Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see Map 7, page 113). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nVikram Samvat The era beginning in the 58 BCE is traditionally associated with Gupta king, Chandragupta II, who had founded it as a mark of victory over the Shakas and assumed the title of Vikramaditya.

They needed large, compact blocks of land but could only acquire small, scattered plots. Attempting to lease land and evict peasants led to conflicts.\n2.  **Labor mobilization**: A large plantation required many laborers, but labor was needed precisely when peasants were busy with their rice cultivation.\n3.  **Equipment**: Large-scale 'nij' cultivation demanded many ploughs and bullocks (two ploughs per bigha). Investing in their purchase and maintenance was a significant problem, and supplies were hard to obtain from peasants whose ploughs and bullocks were occupied with rice fields.\n\nFor the 'ryoti' cultivation system, the challenges for the cultivators were:\n1.  **Low prices and debt trap**: Peasants received very low prices for the indigo they produced, leading to an unending cycle of loans despite initial cash advances.\n2.  **Soil depletion and crop displacement**: Planters insisted on cultivating indigo on the best soils, which peasants preferred for growing rice. Moreover, indigo had deep roots and rapidly exhausted the soil, making it unsuitable for rice cultivation after an indigo harvest.\n\nAnswer: Under the 'nij' system, planters faced challenges in expanding cultivation due to the scarcity of large, compact fertile land, conflicts arising from attempts to evict peasants, difficulties in mobilizing labor when peasants were busy with rice, and the high cost and unavailability of numerous ploughs and bullocks. Under the 'ryoti' system, cultivators struggled with receiving very low prices for their indigo, which trapped them in an endless cycle of debt, and were forced to grow indigo on their best soils, which exhausted the land and prevented them from growing rice afterwards."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.10.9", "6.7.5", "6.4.4", "6.11.3", "8.3.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development.

Here, both the State and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs.

A Sanskrit prashasti (see Chapter 2 for an example of a prashasti ) praising the Delhi Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban (1266-1287) explained that he was the ruler of a vast empire that stretched from Bengal (Gauda) in the east to Ghazni (Gajjana) in Afghanistan in the west and included all of south India (Dravida). People of different regions \u2013 Gauda, Andhra, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat \u2013 apparently fled before his armies. Historians regard these as exaggerated claims of conquests. At the same time, they try to understand why rulers kept claiming to have control over different parts of the subcontinent. \nBy 700 many regions already possessed distinct geographical dimensions and their own language and cultural characteristics. You will learn more about these in Chapter 9. They were also associated with specific ruling dynasties. There was considerable conflict between these states. Occasionally dynasties like the Cholas, Khaljis, Tughluqs and Mughals were able to build an empire that was pan-regional \u2013 spanning diverse regions. Not all these empires were equally stable or successful. Compare, for example, Table 1 in Chapters 3 and 4. What was the duration of rule of the Khalji and Mughal dynasties? \nWhen the Mughal Empire declined in the eighteenth century, it led to the re-emergence of regional states (Chapter 10). But years of imperial, pan-regional rule had altered the character of the regions. Across most of the subcontinent the regions were left with the legacies of the big and small states that had ruled over them. This was apparent in the emergence of many distinct and shared traditions: in the realms of governance, the management of the economy, elite cultures, and language. Through the thousand years between 700 and 1750 the character of the different regions did not grow in isolation. These regions felt the impact of larger pan-regional forces of integration without ever quite losing their distinctiveness. \nIn 1318 the poet Amir Khusrau noted that there was a different language in every region of this land: Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri (in southern Karnataka), Telangani (in Andhra Pradesh), Gujari (in Gujarat), Ma\u2018bari (in Tamil Nadu), Gauri, (in Bengal) \u2026 Awadhi (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) and Hindawi (in the area around Delhi). Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region. It was an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d. Make a list of the languages mentioned by Amir Khusrau. Prepare another list of the names of languages spoken today in the regions he mentioned. Underline names that are similar and circle those that are different. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the poet Amir Khusrau in 1318, what were the key characteristics of regional languages versus Sanskrit in the Indian subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

The text then contrasts these regional languages with Sanskrit, stating, 'Amir Khusrau went on to explain that in contrast to these languages there was Sanskrit which did not belong to any region.'\n3. Furthermore, Khusrau described Sanskrit as 'an old language and \u201ccommon people do not know it, only the Brahmanas do\u201d.'\n4. By synthesizing these observations, it's clear that Amir Khusrau distinguished regional languages as diverse and localized, while Sanskrit was non-regional, ancient, and known exclusively by Brahmanas, not by the common populace.\n\nAnswer: In 1318, Amir Khusrau observed that each region had its own distinct language, such as Sindhi, Lahori, Kashmiri, Dvarsamudri, Telangani, Gujari, Ma\u2018bari, Gauri, Awadhi, and Hindawi.

Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nRuling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent with such a diversity of people and cultures was an extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplish in the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the administrative structure of Akbar's empire, including its divisions and key officials, and explain the core tenets of his policy of \"sulh-i kul.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details Akbar's administration in the 'Ain-i Akbari,' stating that the empire was divided into 'subas' (provinces).

These included the Banjaras (see also Chapter 7). Several traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors who bought horses. \nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards \u2013 the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. \nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China. \nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive. This eventually drew European traders to India. We will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns. \nWith its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in present-day Afghanistan) became politically and commercially important from the sixteenth century onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was primarily carried on through this route. In the seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum in those days. Camels carried dried fruits, dates, carpets, silks and even fresh fruits from Kabul to the subcontinent and elsewhere. Slaves were also brought here for sale. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWhile Magadha became a powerful kingdom, Vajji, with its capital at Vaishali (Bihar), was under a different form of government, known as gana or sangha. \nIn a gana or a sangha there were not one, but many rulers. Sometimes, even when thousands of men ruled together, each one was known as a raja. These rajas performed rituals together. They also met in assemblies, and decided what had to be done and how, through discussion and debate. For example, if they were attacked by an enemy, they met to discuss what should be done to meet the threat. However, women, dasas and kammakaras could not participate in these assemblies. \nBoth the Buddha and Mahavira (about whom you will read in Chapter 7) belonged to ganas or sanghas. Some of the most vivid descriptions of life in the sanghas can be found in Buddhist books. \nRajas of powerful kingdoms tried to conquer the sanghas. Nevertheless, these lasted for a very long time, till about 1500 years ago, when the last of the ganas or sanghas were conquered by the Gupta rulers, about whom you will read in Chapter 11. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe city of Dholavira was located on Khadir Beyt (also spelled as Bet) in the Rann of Kutch, where there was fresh water and fertile soil. Unlike some of the other Harappan cities, which were divided into two parts, Dholavira was divided into three parts, and each part was surrounded with massive stone walls, with entrances through gateways. There was also a large open area in the settlement, where public ceremonies could be held. Other finds include large letters of the Harappan script that were carved out of white stone and perhaps inlaid in wood. This is a unique find as generally Harappan writing has been found on small objects such as seals. \nThe city of Lothal stood beside a tributary of the Sabarmati, in Gujarat, close to the Gulf of Khambat. It was situated near areas where raw materials such as semi-precious stones were easily available. This was an important centre for making objects out of stone, shell and metal. There was also a store house in the city. Many seals and sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were found in this storehouse. \nA building that was found here was probably a workshop for making beads: pieces of stone, half made beads, tools for bead making, and finished beads have all been found here. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nYou may have heard about the Vedas. There are four of them \u2013 the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or \u201cwell-said\u201d. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. \nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis). Priests taught students to recite and memorise each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with great care. Most of the hymns were composed, taught and learnt by men. A few were composed by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. \nThe books we use are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe \u201cBlue Rebellion\u201d and After \n\n In March 1859 thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow indigo. As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary factors that empowered the indigo ryots to rebel in 1859, and how did the British government initially respond to the escalating rebellion?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text identifies two main factors that empowered the indigo ryots to rebel in 1859: \n1.  **Support from local authorities:** The ryots 'felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen'.

They were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages they visited, and set them to music. \nThere were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different caste backgrounds such as potters, \u201cuntouchable\u201d workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and chiefs. The best known among them were Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are two sets of compilations of their songs \u2013 Tevaram and Tiruvacakam. There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally divergent backgrounds, the best known being Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya Prabandham. \nBetween the tenth and twelfth centuries the Chola and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening the links between the bhakti tradition and temple worship. This was also the time when their poems were compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also composed. Today we use these texts as sources for writing histories of the bhakti tradition. \nHagiography : Writing of saints\u2019 lives. \nThis is a composition of Manikkavasagar: Into my vile body of flesh You came, as though it were a temple of gold, And soothed me wholly and saved me, O Lord of Grace, O Gem most Pure, Sorrow and birth and death and illusion You took from me, and set me free. O Bliss! O Light!

The authors of tawarikh were learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. \nThe circle of justice - Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century: A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king promotes justice and honest governance. \nKeep the following additional details in mind: (1) the authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. (3) These authors advised rulers on the need to preserve an \u201cideal\u201d social order based on birthright and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared by everybody. \nIn 1236 Sultan Iltutmish\u2019s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified than all her brothers. But he was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. She was removed from the throne in 1240. \nBirthright - Privileges claimed on account of birth. For example, people believed that nobles inherited their rights to govern, because they were born in certain families. Gender distinctions - Social and biological differences between women and men. Usually, these differences are used to argue that men are superior to women. \nWhat Minhaj-i Siraj thought about Raziyya? Minhaj-i Siraj thought that the queen\u2019s rule went against the ideal social order created by God, in which women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He therefore asked: \u201cIn the register of God\u2019s creation, since her account did not fall under the column of men, how did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?\u201d On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi (1262- 1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in Kashmir (980- 1003). Her title is interesting: it comes from \u201cdidi\u201d or \u201celder sister\u201d, an obviously affectionate term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Inamgaon on Map 2 (page14).

This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society.

When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe most famous Kushana ruler was Kanishka, who ruled around 1900 years ago. He organised a Buddhist council, where scholars met and discussed important matters. Ashvaghosha, a poet who composed a biography of the Buddha, the Buddhacharita, lived in his court. Ashvaghosha and other Buddhist scholars now began writing in Sanskrit. \nA new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct features. Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For instance, his attainment of enlightenment was shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. \nNow, statues of the Buddha were made. Many of these were made in Mathura, while others were made in Taxila. \nThe second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. These were supposed to be persons who had attained enlightenment. Once they attained enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing that, they remained in the world to teach and help other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, China, and later to Korea and Japan \nBuddhism also spread to western and southern India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of hills for monks to live in. \nSome of these caves were made on the orders of kings and queens, others by merchants and farmers. These were often located near passes through the Western Ghats. Roads connecting prosperous ports on the coast with cities in the Deccan ran through these passes. Traders probably halted in these cave monasteries during their travels. \nBuddhism also spread south eastwards, to Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was more popular in these areas. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Prior to the development of Mahayana Buddhism, how was the Buddha's enlightenment typically represented, and what historical event and specific symbol inspired this earlier method of representation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text states that 'Earlier, the Buddha\u2019s presence was shown in sculpture by using certain signs.

The second text provides the historical context for the peepal tree symbol, noting that Siddhartha 'meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment.' Combining these, the earlier representation was symbolic, specifically using the peepal tree, inspired by the Buddha's actual enlightenment under such a tree, before Mahayana Buddhism introduced direct statues.\n\nAnswer: Earlier, the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment was typically shown by using symbols, such as sculptures of the peepal tree.

Let\u2019s travel in our imagination to Thanjavur, the capital of the Cholas, as it was a thousand years ago. The perennial river Kaveri flows near this beautiful town. One hears the bells of the Rajarajeshvara temple built by King Rajaraja Chola. The towns people are all praise for its architect Kunjaramallan Rajaraja Perunthachchan who has proudly carved his name on the temple wall. Inside is a massive Shiva linga. \nBesides the temple, there are palaces with mandapas or pavilions. Kings hold court in these mandapas, issuing orders to their subordinates. There are also barracks for the army. \nThe town is bustling with markets selling grain, spices, cloth and jewellery. Water supply for the town comes from wells and tanks. The Saliya weavers of Thanjavur and the nearby town of Uraiyur are busy producing cloth for flags to be used in the temple festival, fine cottons for the king and nobility and coarse cotton for the masses. Some distance away at Svamimalai, the sthapatis or sculptors are making exquisite bronze idols and tall, ornamental bell metal lamps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather than janas. The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red. One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and geometric patterns. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAkbar ordered one of his close friends and courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume history of Akbar\u2019s reign, titled Akbar Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar\u2019s ancestors and the second volume recorded the events of Akbar\u2019s reign. The third volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with Akbar\u2019s administration, household, army, the revenues and the geography of his empire. It also provides rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. The most interesting aspect about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crops, yields, prices, wages and revenues. \nThe broad features of administration were laid down by Akbar and were elaborately discussed by Abul Fazl in his book, the Akbar Nama, in particular in its last volume, the Ain-i Akbari. Abul Fazl explained that the empire was divided into provinces called subas, governed by a subadar who carried out both political and military functions. Each province also had a financial officer or diwan. For the maintenance of peace and order in his province, the subadar was supported by other officers such as the military paymaster (bakhshi), the minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage (sadr), military commanders (faujdars) and the town police commander (kotwal). \nAkbar\u2019s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue. While they were loyal the empire functioned efficiently but by the end of the seventeenth century many nobles had built independent networks of their own. Their loyalties to the empire were weakened by their own self-interest. \nWhile Akbar was at Fatehpur Sikri during the 1570s he started discussions on religion with the ulama, Brahmanas, Jesuit priests who were Roman Catholics, and Zoroastrians. These discussions took place in the ibadat khana. He was interested in the religion and social customs of different people. Akbar\u2019s interaction with people of different faiths made him realise that religious scholars who emphasised ritual and dogma were often bigots. Their teachings created divisions and disharmony amongst his subjects. This eventually led Akbar to the idea of sulh-i kul or \u201cuniversal peace\u201d. This idea of tolerance did not discriminate between people of different religions in his realm. Instead it focused on a system of ethics \u2013 honesty, justice, peace \u2013 that was universally applicable. Abul Fazl helped Akbar in framing a vision of governance around this idea of sulh-i kul. This principle of governance was followed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan as well. \nSulh-i kul Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, described his father\u2019s policy of sulh-i kul in the following words: As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so \u2026 in his Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the principle of \u201cuniversal peace\u201d (sulh-i kul). \nDogma : A statement or an interpretation declared as authoritative with the expectation that it would be followed without question. Bigot : An individual who is intolerant of another person\u2019s religious beliefs or culture. \nAkbar commissioned the translation of many Sanskrit works into Persian. A Maktab Khana or translation bureau was also established at Fatehpur Sikri for this purpose. The Mahabharata, Ramayana, Lilavati and Yogavashisht were some of the notable Sanskrit works that were taken up for translation. The Razmnamah, Persian translation of the Mahabharata contains lavish illustrations of the events of Mahabharata. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, describe the administrative structure and significant cultural or religious policies implemented during Akbar's reign, and detail the key artistic and architectural achievements of the Chola dynasty."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first extract details about Akbar's administrative structure and cultural/religious policies from the relevant section. The text in the second section explicitly states that Akbar's empire was divided into 'subas' governed by a 'subadar' (who carried out both political and military functions) and a 'diwan' (financial officer). It further lists supporting officers for the subadar: 'bakhshi' (military paymaster), 'sadr' (minister in charge of religious and charitable patronage), 'faujdars' (military commanders), and 'kotwal' (town police commander). For cultural/religious policies, it mentions Akbar's idea of 'sulh-i kul' (universal peace) promoting tolerance and ethics, and his commissioning of Sanskrit work translations into Persian via a 'Maktab Khana'.\n\nNext, I will identify the key artistic and architectural achievements of the Chola dynasty.

Most families are related to one another and groups of such families form a tribe. \nMembers of a tribe follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing. Usually, women do most of the agricultural work, including preparing the ground, sowing seeds, looking after the growing plants and harvesting grain. Children often look after plants, driving away animals and birds that might eat them. Women also thresh, husk, and grind grain. Men usually lead large herds of animals in search of pasture. Children often look after small flocks. The cleaning of animals and milking, is done by both men and women. Both women and men make pots, baskets, tools and huts. They also take part in singing, dancing and decorating their huts. \nSome men are regarded as leaders. They may be old and experienced, or young, brave warriors, or priests. Old women are respected for their wisdom and experience. \nTribes have rich and unique cultural traditions, including their own language, music, stories and paintings. They also have their own gods and goddesses. \nWhat makes tribes different from many other societies you will be studying about is that land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together. There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFrom the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns. These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain. Some of these taxes were collected in kind, while others were collected in cash. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary differences in economic organization and resource ownership between the small towns that emerged from the eighth century and tribal societies?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  **Economic Organization of Towns (Section 1):** The text describes towns as having 'mandapika (or mandi)' and 'market streets called hatta (haat) lined with shops,' indicating a market-based economy driven by trade. Villagers brought produce to sell, and traders bought local articles while selling products from distant places. Authorities like samantas or zamindars 'levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade,' demonstrating a system of taxation and a more complex, hierarchical economic structure.\n2.  **Resource Ownership in Towns (Section 1):** While not explicitly stating 'private ownership,' the presence of 'shops,' 'traders,' 'artisans,' and 'taxes on articles of trade' implies individual or group ownership of businesses, goods, and the means of production, which were subject to taxation.\n3.  **Economic Organization of Tribal Societies (Section 2):** The text states that members of a tribe 'follow occupations such as hunting, gathering, farming, herding and fishing.' The description of labor division (women for agriculture, men for herds) suggests a subsistence-based economy focused on communal production and survival rather than extensive trade and taxation.\n4.  **Resource Ownership in Tribal Societies (Section 2):** The text explicitly highlights a key difference: 'land, forests, grasslands and water are regarded as the wealth of the entire tribe, and everybody shares and uses these together.' Furthermore, it notes, 'There are no sharp differences between the rich and the poor,' indicating an egalitarian approach to economic resources and wealth.\n5.  **Synthesis of Differences:** The towns had a market-oriented economy with trade, specialized artisans, and a system of taxation levied by authorities, implying private or controlled ownership of economic assets. Tribal societies, conversely, operated on a subsistence economy with communal ownership of natural resources (land, forests, grasslands, water) and an absence of significant economic disparity among their members.\n\nAnswer: The small towns featured a market-based economy with extensive trade, specialized artisans, and a system where authorities like samantas or zamindars levied taxes on traders, artisans, and articles of trade. In contrast, tribal societies operated on a subsistence economy involving hunting, gathering, farming, herding, and fishing, with land, forests, grasslands, and water regarded as the shared wealth of the entire tribe, leading to no sharp differences between the rich and the poor."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.4", "6.3.8"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nOver centuries, India\u2019s intellectual exploration of truth has come to be represented by six systems of philosophy.

German-born British indologist, Friedrich Max Muller, has observed that the six systems of philosophy were developed over many generations with contributions made by individual thinkers. However, today, we find an underlying harmony in their understanding of truth, although they seem distinct from each other. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSiddhartha, also known as Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, was born about 2500 years ago. This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said. Let us see how he did this. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Rome on Map 6 (page 84). This is one of the oldest cities in Europe, and developed around the same time as the cities in the Ganga valley. Rome was the capital of one of the largest empires \u2014 one that spread across Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. Augustus, one of the most important emperors, who ruled about 2000 years ago, said that he found Rome a city of brick, and made it into a city of marble. He, and later rulers, built temples and palaces. \nThey also built huge amphitheatres \u2014 open arenas surrounded by tiers of seats \u2014 where citizens could watch all kinds of shows, and public baths (with separate timings for men and women), where people met and relaxed. Huge aqueducts \u2014 channels to supply water \u2014 were built to bring water to the city \u2014 for the baths, fountains and toilets. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order, using simple, logical arguments. Among them were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas and Yogis. They advocated renunciation of the world. To them the path to salvation lay in meditation on the formless Ultimate Reality and the realisation of oneness with it. To achieve this they advocated intense training of the mind and body through practices like yogasanas, breathing exercises and meditation. These groups became particularly popular among \u201clow\u201d castes.

Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nArchaeologists think that objects found with a skeleton probably belonged to the dead person. Sometimes, more objects are found in one grave than in another. Find Brahmagiri on Map 2 (page 14). Here, one skeleton was buried with 33 gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and one conch shell. Other skeletons have only a few pots. These finds suggest that there was some difference in status amongst the people who were buried. Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFranchise \u2013 The right to vote. \n \nA Constitution is Written \n\n Between December 1946 and November 1949, some three hundred Indians had a series of meetings on the country\u2019s political future. The meetings of this \u201cConstituent Assembly\u201d were held in New Delhi, but the participants came from all over India, and from different political parties. These discussions resulted in the framing of the Indian Constitution, which came into effect on 26 January 1950. \nOne feature of the Constitution was its adoption of universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections. This was a revolutionary step \u2013 for never before had Indians been allowed to choose their own leaders. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, this right had been granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote. Then men who were educated were also added on. Working-class men got the vote only after a long struggle. Finally, after a bitter struggle of their own, American and British women were granted the vote. On the other hand, soon after Independence, India chose to grant this right to all its citizens regardless of gender, class or education. \nA second feature of the Constitution was that it guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation. There were some Indians who wished that the political system of the new nation be based on Hindu ideals, and that India itself be run as a Hindu state. They pointed to the example of Pakistan, a country created explicitly to protect and further the interests of a particular religious community \u2013 the Muslims. However, the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was of the opinion that India could not and must not become a \u201cHindu Pakistan\u201d. \nBesides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus \u2013 the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law. \nA third feature of the Constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The practice of untouchability, described as a \u201cslur and a blot\u201d on the \u201cfair name of India\u201d, was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes. It had been argued by some that Untouchable or as they were now known, Harijan, candidates did not have good enough grades to get into the prestigious Indian Administrative Service. But, as one member of the Constituent Assembly, H.J. Khandekar, argued, it was the upper castes who were responsible for the Harijans \u201cbeing unfit today\u201d. Addressing his more privileged colleagues, Khandekar said: We were suppressed for thousands of years. You engaged us in your service to serve your own ends and suppressed us to such an extent that neither our minds nor our bodies and nor even our hearts work, nor are we able to march forward. \nAlong with the former Untouchables, the adivasis or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The tribals had been deprived of modern health care and education, while their lands and forests had been taken away by more powerful outsiders. The new privileges granted them by the Constitution were meant to make amends for this. \nThe Constituent Assembly spent many days discussing the powers of the central government versus those of the state governments. Some members thought that the Centre\u2019s interests should be foremost. Only a strong Centre, it was argued, \u201cwould be in a position to think and plan for the well-being of the country as a whole\u201d. Other members felt that the provinces should have greater autonomy and freedom. A member from Mysore feared that under the present system \u201cdemocracy is centred in Delhi and it is not allowed to work in the same sense and spirit in the rest of the country\u201d. A member from Madras insisted that \u201cthe initial responsibility for the well-being of the people of the provinces should rest with the Provincial Governments\u201d. \nThe Constitution sought to balance these competing claims by providing three lists of subjects: a Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre; a State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states; a Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility. \nAnother major debate in the Constituent Assembly concerned language. Many members believed that the English language should leave India with the British rulers. Its place, they argued, should be taken by Hindi. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of a different opinion. Speaking in the Assembly, T.T. Krishnamachari conveyed \u201ca warning on behalf of people of the South\u201d, some of whom threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. A compromise was finally arrived at: namely, that while Hindi would be the \u201cofficial language\u201d of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another. \nMany Indians contributed to the framing of the Constitution. But perhaps the most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and under whose supervision the document was finalised. In his final speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr Ambedkar pointed out that political democracy had to be accompanied by economic and social democracy. Giving the right to vote would not automatically lead to the removal of other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper and lower castes. With the new Constitution, he said, India was going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man one vote and one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Considering how historians analyze social and economic transformations over time, what were the key features of the Indian Constitution, as framed by the Constituent Assembly, that specifically aimed to address historical social and economic inequalities within the subcontinent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The first text highlights that historians study time as a reflection of \"changes in social and economic organisation,\" emphasizing the importance of societal transformation. The second text details the framing of the Indian Constitution by the Constituent Assembly between December 1946 and November 1949.

We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord!

You will notice that the Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as the Mughals became powerful many other rulers also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good example of this. Many of them married their daughters into Mughal families and received high positions. But many resisted as well \nThe mother of Jahangir was a Kachhwaha princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Amber (modernday Jaipur). The mother of Shah Jahan was a Rathor princess, daughter of the Rajput ruler of Marwar (Jodhpur). \nThe Sisodiya Rajputs of Mewar refused to accept Mughal authority for a long time. Once defeated, however, they were honourably treated by the Mughals, given their lands (watan) back as assignments (watan jagir). The careful balance between defeating but not humiliating their opponents enabled the Mughals to extend their influence over many kings and chieftains.

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nXuan Zang, and other pilgrims spent time studying in Nalanda, (Bihar) the most famous Buddhist monastery of the period. This is how he describes it: \u201cThe teachers are men of the highest ability and talent. They follow the teachings of the Buddha in all sincerity. The rules of the monastery are strict, and everyone has to follow them. Discussions are held throughout the day, and the old and the young mutually help one another. Learned men from different cities come here to settle their doubts. The gatekeeper asks new entrants difficult questions. They are allowed to enter only after they have been able to answer these. Seven or eight out of every ten are not able to answer.\u201d \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe sants had much in common with the Sufis, so much so that it is believed that they adopted many ideas of each other. Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was in no other place. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nYou may have noticed how wealth is measured in terms of coins in the story on page 90. Archaeologists have found several thousands of coins belonging to this period. The earliest coins which were in use for about 500 years were punch marked coins, \nPunch-marked coins were generally rectangular or sometimes square or round in shape, either cut out of metal sheets or made out of flattened metal globules (a small spherical body). The coins were not inscribed, but were stamped with symbols using dies or punches. Hence, they are called punch-marked coins. These coins are found over most parts of the subcontinent and remained in circulation till the early centuries CE. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the immediate and long-term challenges faced by India upon its independence in August 1947, and how were the problems of unity and development interconnected in addressing these challenges?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that when India became independent in August 1947, it faced immediate challenges including finding homes and jobs for 8 million refugees from Partition and persuading almost 500 princely states to join the new nation.

Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya).

In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made. These developments took place simultaneously, i.e. at the same time. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of the book. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe study of the thousand years between 700 and 1750 is a huge challenge to historians largely because of the scale and variety of developments that occurred over the period. At different moments in this period new technologies made their appearance \u2013 like the Persian wheel in irrigation, the spinning wheel in weaving, and firearms in combat. New foods and beverages arrived in the subcontinent \u2013 potatoes, corn, chillies, tea and coffee. Remember that all these innovations \u2013 new technologies and crops \u2013 came along with people, who brought other ideas with them as well. As a result, this was a period of economic, political, social and cultural changes. You will learn about some of these changes in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. \nThis was also a period of great mobility. Groups of people travelled long distances in search of opportunity. The subcontinent held immense wealth and the possibilities for people to carve a fortune. One group of people who became important in this period were the Rajputs, a name derived from \u201cRajaputra\u201d, the son of a ruler. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries the term was applied more generally to a group of warriors who claimed Kshatriya caste status. The term included not just rulers and chieftains but also soldiers and commanders who served in the armies of different monarchs all over the subcontinent. A chivalric code of conduct \u2013 extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty \u2013 were the qualities attributed to Rajputs by their poets and bards. Other groups of people such as the Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, Ahoms and Kayasthas (a caste of scribes and secretaries) also used the opportunities of the age to become politically important. \nThroughout this period there was a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture, a change faster and more complete in some areas than in others. Changes in their habitat forced many forest-dwellers to migrate. Others started tilling the land and became peasants. These new peasant groups gradually began to be influenced by regional markets, chieftains, priests, monasteries and temples. They became part of large, complex societies, and were required to pay taxes and offer goods and services to local lords. As a result, significant economic and social differences emerged amongst peasants. Some possessed more productive land, others also kept cattle, and some combined artisanal work with agricultural activity during the lean season. As society became more differentiated, people were grouped into jatis or sub-castes and ranked on the basis of their backgrounds and their occupations. Ranks were not fixed permanently, and varied according to the power, influence and resources controlled by members of the jati. The status of the same jati could vary from area to area. \nJatis framed their own rules and regulations to manage the conduct of their members. These regulations were enforced by an assembly of elders, described in some areas as the jati panchayat. But jatis were also required to follow the rules of their villages. Several villages were governed by a chieftain. Together they were only one small unit of a state. \nHabitat - Refers to the environment of a region and the social and economic lifestyle of its residents. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhat would a traveller visiting a medieval town expect to find? This would depend on what kind of a town it was \u2013 a temple town, an administrative centre, a commercial town or a port town to name just some possibilities. In fact, many towns combined several functions \u2013 they were administrative centres, temple towns, as well as centres of commercial activities and craft production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA Harappan city was a very busy place. There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, how did the described characteristics and activities of a Harappan city differ from the typical functions identified for medieval towns?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Identify Harappan City Characteristics (Section 1):** The first text describes a Harappan city as having rulers who planned buildings, sent people for resources (metal, precious stones), and kept valuables. It also mentions scribes who knew how to write and helped prepare seals, and craftspersons making various things. People traveled for raw materials. This highlights a focus on administration, resource management, specialized crafts, and internal city roles.\n2. **Identify Medieval Town Functions (Section 4):** The fourth text explains that medieval towns had diverse functions, which could include being a temple town, an administrative centre, a commercial town, or a port town. It also notes that many towns combined several of these functions.\n3. **Compare and Contrast:** The Harappan city description focuses on the specific roles of people within the city (rulers, scribes, craftspersons) and their activities related to governance, resource acquisition, and production. In contrast, the medieval towns are characterized by their overarching societal purpose or identity (e.g., religious, governmental, trade-oriented), often integrating multiple such functions. While both periods involved craft production, the medieval period explicitly categorizes towns by their primary functional identity, suggesting a more diversified and specialized urban landscape in terms of purpose.\n\nAnswer: A Harappan city was characterized by specific roles such as rulers planning construction, acquiring resources from distant lands, and keeping valuables, alongside scribes who helped with writing and craftspersons producing goods. In contrast, medieval towns were identified by their diverse functions, which could include being a temple town, an administrative centre, a commercial town, or a port town, with many often combining several of these roles, indicating a more varied and specialized urban purpose."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.4", "7.1.4", "6.8.9", "7.6.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later. The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in large library collections. \nArchive - A place where documents and manuscripts are stored. Today all national and state governments have archives where they keep all their old official records and transactions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThese stone boulders are known as megaliths (literally big stones). These were carefully arranged by people, and were used to mark burial sites. The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. \nSome important megalithic sites are shown on Map 2 (page14). While some megaliths can be seen on the surface, other megalithic burials are often underground. \nSometimes, archaeologists find a circle of stone boulders or a single large stone standing on the ground. These are the only indications that there are burials beneath. \nThere were several things that people did to make megaliths. We have made a list here. Try and arrange them in the correct order: digging pits in the earth, transporting stones, breaking boulders, placing stones in position, finding suitable stone, shaping stones, burying the dead. \nAll these burials have some common features. Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. Also found are tools and weapons of iron and sometimes, skeletons of horses, horse equipment and ornaments of stone and gold. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka \n Women from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement. During the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed to women\u2019s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAbout 2500 years ago, some janapadas became more important than others, and were known as mahajanapadas. Some of these are shown on Map 4. Most mahajanapadas had a capital city, many of these were fortified. This means that huge walls of wood, brick or stone were built around them. \nForts were probably built because people were afraid of attacks from other kings and needed protection. It is also likely that some rulers wanted to show how rich and powerful they were by building really large, tall and impressive walls around their cities. Also in this way, the land and the people living inside the fortified area could be controlled more easily by the king. Building such huge walls required a great deal of planning. Thousands, if not lakhs of bricks or stones had to be prepared. This in turn meant enormous labour, provided, possibly, by thousands of men, women and children. And resources had to be found for all of this. \nThe new rajas now began maintaining armies. Soldiers were paid regular salaries and maintained by the king throughout the year. Some payments were probably made using punch marked coins (see the illustration on page 92). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nIf somebody asks you the date, you will probably mention the day, month and year, 2000 and something.

Is there any way of finding out whether women hunted, or men made stone tools, whether women painted or men gathered fruits and nuts? At present, we do not really know. However, there are at least two possibilities. It is likely that both men and women may have done many of these things together. It is also possible that some tasks were done only by women and others only by men. And again, there could have been different practices in different parts of the subcontinent. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nContemporary historians and travellers give very scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Given that tribal people did not keep written records, what primary method do present-day historians use to reconstruct their histories?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The second text section explicitly states that \"tribal people did not keep written records.\" However, it immediately follows by noting that \"But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions.

Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nKnighthood \u2013 An honour granted by the British Crown for exceptional personal achievement or public service. \n Picket \u2013 People protesting outside a building or shop to prevent others from entering. \n Mahants \u2013 Religious functionaries of Sikh gurdwaras. \n Illegal eviction \u2013 Forcible and unlawful throwing out of tenants from the land they rent. \n \nThe Growth of Mass Nationalism \n\n After 1919 the struggle against British rule gradually became a mass movement, involving peasants, tribals, students and women in large numbers and occasionally factory workers as well. Certain business groups too began to actively support the Congress in the 1920s. Why was this so? \nThe First World War altered the economic and political situation in India. It led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to a sharp rise in prices which created great difficulties for the common people. On the other hand, business groups reaped fabulous profits from the war. As you have seen (Chapter 7), the war created a demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. So Indian industries expanded during the war, and Indian business groups began to demand greater opportunities for development. \nThe war also lead the British to expand their army. Villages were pressurised to supply soldiers for an alien cause. A large number of soldiers were sent to serve abroad. Many returned after the war with an understanding of the ways in which imperialist powers were exploiting the peoples of Asia and Africa and with a desire to oppose colonial rule in India. Furthermore, in 1917 there was a revolution in Russia. News about peasants\u2019 and workers\u2019 struggles and ideas of socialism circulated widely, inspiring Indian nationalists. \nThe advent of Mahatma Gandhi \n It is in these circumstances that Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a mass leader. As you may know, Gandhiji, aged 46, arrived in India in 1915 from South Africa. Having led Indians in that country in non-violent marches against racist restrictions, he was already a respected leader, known internationally. His South African campaigns had brought him in contact with various types of Indians: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and Christians; Gujaratis, Tamils and north Indians; and upper-class merchants, lawyers and workers. \nMahatma Gandhi spent his first year in India travelling throughout the country, understanding the people, their needs and the overall situation. His earliest interventions were in local movements in Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad where he came into contact with Rajendra Prasad and Vallabhbhai Patel. In Ahmedabad he led a successful millworkers\u2019 strike in 1918. Let us now focus in some detail on the movements organised between 1919 and 1922. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha \n In 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act that the British had just passed. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others felt that the government had no right to restrict people\u2019s basic freedoms. They criticised the Act as \u201cdevilish\u201d and tyrannical. Gandhiji asked the Indian people to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to this Act, as a day of \u201chumiliation and prayer\u201d and hartal (strike). Satyagraha Sabhas were set up to launch the movement. \nThe Rowlatt Satyagraha turned out to be the first all-India struggle against the British government although it was largely restricted to cities. In April 1919 there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country and the government used brutal measures to suppress them. The Jallianwala Bagh atrocities, inflicted by General Dyer in Amritsar on Baisakhi day (13 April), were a part of this repression. On learning about the massacre, Rabindranath Tagore expressed the pain and anger of the country by renouncing his knighthood. \nDuring the Rowlatt Satyagraha the participants tried to ensure that Hindus and Muslims were united in the fight against British rule. This was also the call of Mahatma Gandhi who always saw India as a land of all the people who lived in the country \u2013 Hindus, Muslims and those of other religions. He was keen that Hindus and Muslims support each other in any just cause. \nKhilafat agitation and the Non-Cooperation Movement The Khilafat issue was one such cause. In 1920 the British imposed a harsh treaty on the Turkish Sultan or Khalifa. People were furious about this as they had been about the Jallianwala massacre. Also, Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported their call and urged the Congress to campaign against \u201cPunjab wrongs\u201d (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand swaraj. \nThe Non-Cooperation Movement gained momentum through 1921-22. Thousands of students left government-controlled schools and colleges. Many lawyers such as Motilal Nehru, C.R. Das, C. Rajagopalachari and Asaf Ali gave up their practices. British titles were surrendered and legislatures boycotted. People lit public bonfires of foreign cloth. The imports of foreign cloth fell drastically between 1920 and 1922. But all this was merely the tip of the iceberg. Large parts of the country were on the brink of a formidable revolt. \nPeople\u2019s initiatives \n In many cases people resisted British rule non-violently. In others, different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji\u2019s call in their own manner, protested in ways that were not in accordance with his ideas. In either case, people linked their movements to local grievances. Let us look at a few examples. \nIn Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British. In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed. In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of \u201cforest satyagrahas\u201d, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee. They were protesting because the colonial state had restricted their use of forest resources in various ways. They believed that Gandhiji would get their taxes reduced and have the forest regulations abolished. In many forest villages, peasants proclaimed swaraj and believed that \u201cGandhi Raj\u201d was about to be established. \nIn Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non-Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement. \nIn Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to remove corrupt mahants \u2013 supported by the British \u2013 from their gurdwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement. In Assam, tea garden labourers, shouting \u201cGandhi Maharaj ki Jai\u201d, demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations amidst declarations that they were following Gandhiji\u2019s wish. Interestingly, in the Assamese Vaishnava songs of the period the reference to Krishna was substituted by \u201cGandhi Raja\u201d. \nThe people\u2019s Mahatma \n We can see from the above that sometimes people thought of Gandhiji as a kind of messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty. Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars, and agricultural labourers believed he would provide them land. At times, ordinary people credited Gandhiji with their own achievements. For instance, at the end of a powerful movement, peasants of Pratapgarh in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) managed to stop illegal eviction of tenants; but they felt it was Gandhiji who had won this demand for them. At other times, using Gandhiji\u2019s name, tribals and peasants undertook actions that did not conform to Gandhian ideals. \nThe happenings of 1922 -1929 \n Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, was against violent movements. He abruptly called off the Non-Cooperation Movement when in February 1922 a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Twenty-two policemen were killed on that day. The peasants were provoked because the police had fired on their peaceful demonstration. \nOnce the Non-Cooperation movement was over, Gandhiji\u2019s followers stressed that the Congress must undertake constructive work in the rural areas. Other leaders such as Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru argued that the party should fight elections to the councils and enter them in order to influence government policies. Through sincere social work in villages in the mid-1920s, the Gandhians were able to extend their support base. This proved to be very useful in launching the Civil Disobedience movement in 1930. \nTwo important developments of the mid-1920s were the formation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu organisation, and the Communist Party of India. These parties have held very different ideas about the kind of country India should be. Find out about their ideas with the help of your teacher. The revolutionary nationalist Bhagat Singh too was active in this period. \nThe decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru. Consequently, \u201cIndependence Day\u201d was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMercantile \u2013 A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade, buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices \nEast India Company Comes East \n\n In 1800, the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England, Queen Elizabeth I, granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\n\u201cGeneral\u201dconstituencies - Election districts with no reservations for any religious or other community \nQuit India and Later \n\n Mahatma Gandhi decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British in the middle of the Second World War. The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's establishment of trade and political dominance in Bengal, as detailed in the text, contribute to the conditions that later led to the rise of mass nationalist movements against British rule in India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **East India Company's initial strategy and political maneuvering (Text 2):** The East India Company secured a royal charter granting it the sole right to trade with the East, aiming to buy goods cheaply and sell them at higher prices. They established their first factory in Bengal in 1651 and expanded their presence by bribing Mughal officials for zamindari rights and duty-free trade through a 'farman' from Emperor Aurangzeb. Company officials misused these privileges for private trade, causing significant revenue loss for Bengal and leading to intense conflicts with local Nawabs like Murshid Quli Khan, Alivardi Khan, and Sirajuddaulah, who resisted the Company's demands and fortifications.\n2. **Consolidation of power and economic exploitation (Text 2):** The Battle of Plassey in 1757, a major victory for the Company orchestrated by Robert Clive's manipulation of Mir Jafar, led to the assassination of Sirajuddaulah and the installation of puppet nawabs. When these puppet rulers proved uncooperative, the Company deposed them (e.g., Mir Jafar, Mir Qasim). Ultimately, in 1765, the Company was appointed the Diwan of Bengal, which allowed it to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal to finance its trade, maintain troops, and cover administrative costs, effectively stopping the outflow of gold from Britain and solidifying its political and economic control over the region.\n3. **Laying groundwork for mass discontent (Text 1 & 4):** This systematic establishment of British economic and political dominance created the conditions for widespread grievances. The 'Growth of Mass Nationalism' section (Text 1) explains that after 1919, the struggle against British rule became a mass movement due to factors such as a 'huge rise in the defence expenditure' leading to increased taxes and a 'sharp rise in prices' for common people after World War I, alongside the exploitation of soldiers and the curbing of fundamental rights by acts like the Rowlatt Act. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre and other repressive measures further fueled public anger. Mahatma Gandhi's emergence as a mass leader, organizing movements like the Rowlatt Satyagraha and Non-Cooperation Movement (Text 1), and later the Quit India Movement (Text 4), mobilized diverse sections of society against the established British Raj, which had its origins in the Company's early actions and subsequent policies of exploitation and control.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company's early establishment of trade and political dominance in Bengal, achieved through securing exclusive trading rights, bribing Mughal officials for duty-free trade and zamindari, manipulating local rulers through battles like Plassey, and ultimately acquiring the Diwani of Bengal, created the foundation for British colonial exploitation. This systemic control led to increased taxes, rising prices, and the curbing of fundamental rights under British rule, fostering widespread discontent. These grievances, in turn, fueled the later emergence of mass nationalist movements, led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, who mobilized various sections of Indian society against the British Raj and eventually demanded independence."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.9.2", "8.2.2", "7.1.7", "8.9.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists.

Did you notice that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi as its capital? That was because Delhi became an important city only in the twelfth century. \nTake a look at Table 1. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi became an important commercial centre. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins minted here, called dehliwal, had a wide circulation. \nThe transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteenth century.

These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain. Some of these taxes were collected in kind, while others were collected in cash. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\n5 When People Rebel \n 1857 and After \n\n Policies and the People \n\n Nawabs lose their power Since the mid-eighteenth century, nawabs and rajas had seen their power erode. They had gradually lost their authority and honour. Residents had been stationed in many courts, the freedom of the rulers reduced, their armed forces disbanded, and their revenues and territories taken away by stages. \nMany ruling families tried to negotiate with the Company to protect their interests. For example, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi wanted the Company to recognise her adopted son as the heir to the kingdom after the death of her husband. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of Peshwa Baji Rao II, pleaded that he be given his father\u2019s pension when the latter died. However, the Company, confident of its superiority and military powers, turned down these pleas. \nAwadh was one of the last territories to be annexed. In 1801, a subsidiary alliance was imposed on Awadh, and in 1856 it was taken over. Governor -General Dalhousie declared that the territory was being misgoverned and British rule was needed to ensure proper administration. \nThe Company even began to plan how to bring the Mughal dynasty to an end. The name of the Mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the Company. In 1849, Gover nor -General Dalhousie announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the family of the king would be shifted out of the Red Fort and given another place in Delhi to reside in. In 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal king and after his death none of his descendants would be recognised as kings \u2013 they would just be called princes. \nThe peasants and the sepoys \n In the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection. Many failed to pay back their loans to the moneylenders and gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations. \nThe Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company also had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service. Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs. Did you know that in those days many people in the country believed that if they crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste? So when in 1824 the sepoys were told to go to Burma by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to go by the land route. They were severely punished, and since the issue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the Company\u2019s army had to agree to serve overseas if required. \nSepoys also reacted to what was happening in the countryside. Many of them were peasants and had families living in the villages. So the anger of the peasants quickly spread among the sepoys. \nResponses to reforms \n The British believed that Indian society had to be reformed. Laws were passed to stop the practice of sati and to encourage the remarriage of widows. English-language education was actively promoted. After 1830, the Company allowed Christian missionaries to function freely in its domain and even own land and property. In 1850, a new law was passed to make conversion to Christianity easier. This law allowed an Indian who had converted to Christianity to inherit the property of his ancestors. Many Indians began to feel that the British were destroying their religion, their social customs and their traditional way of life. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWomen in the freedom struggle: Ambabai from Karnataka \n Women from diverse backgrounds participated in the national movement. Young and old, single and married, they came from rural and urban areas, from both conservative and liberal homes. Their involvement was significant for the freedom struggle, for the women\u2019s movement, and for themselves personally. \nBoth British officials and Indian nationalists felt that women\u2019s participation gave the national struggle an immense force. Participation in the freedom movement brought women out of their homes. It gave them a place in the professions, in the governance of India, and it could pave the way for equality with men. \nWhat such participation meant for women is best recounted by them. Ambabai of Karnataka had been married at age twelve. Widowed at sixteen, she picketed foreign cloth and liquor shops in Udipi. She was arrested, served a sentence and was rearrested. Between prison terms she made speeches, taught spinning, and organised prabhat pheris. Ambabai regarded these as the happiest days of her life because they gave it a new purpose and commitment. \nWomen, however, had to fight for their right to participate in the movement. During the Salt Satyagraha, for instance, even Mahatma Gandhi was initially opposed to women\u2019s participation. Sarojini Naidu had to persuade him to allow women to join the movement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the main grievances of Indian rulers, peasants, and sepoys against the British East India Company's policies leading up to the mid-19th century, and how did some Indians perceive British social reforms?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for the grievances of specific groups (Indian rulers, peasants, sepoys) against the British East India Company and the perception of British social reforms, based solely on the provided text. The second text section, '5 When People Rebel 1857 and After,' directly addresses these points.\n\n1.  **Grievances of Indian Rulers:** The text states that 'nawabs and rajas had seen their power erode,' losing 'authority and honour,' with 'freedom of the rulers reduced,' 'armed forces disbanded,' and 'revenues and territories taken away.' Examples include the Company turning down Rani Lakshmibai's request to recognize her adopted son as heir and Nana Saheb's plea for his father's pension. Furthermore, the Company planned to end the Mughal dynasty, removing the king's name from coins and declaring Bahadur Shah Zafar as the last Mughal king.\n2.  **Grievances of Peasants:** The text highlights that 'peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection.' This led to many failing to repay loans and 'gradually lost the lands they had tilled for generations.'\n3.  **Grievances of Sepoys:** Sepoys were 'unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service.' Crucially, 'new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs,' such as the refusal to go to Burma by sea route in 1824 and the 1856 law requiring overseas service. Their discontent was also linked to the 'anger of the peasants [that] quickly spread among the sepoys' as many had families in villages.\n4.  **Perception of British Social Reforms:** While the British promoted reforms like stopping sati, encouraging widow remarriage, and English education, and facilitated Christian missionary activities and conversion, 'Many Indians began to feel that the British were destroying their religion, their social customs and their traditional way of life.'\n\nAnswer: Indian rulers, such as nawabs and rajas, resented the erosion of their power, authority, and honor, with their freedom reduced, armed forces disbanded, and territories annexed; for instance, Rani Lakshmibai's adopted son was not recognized as heir, and the Mughal dynasty was planned to be ended. Peasants and zamindars were discontented due to high taxes, rigid revenue collection methods, and the loss of their ancestral lands. Sepoys were unhappy with their pay, allowances, and service conditions, and new rules often violated their religious beliefs, such as the requirement for overseas service. Additionally, many Indians perceived British social reforms, including those promoting English education and Christian missionary activities, as an attempt to destroy their religion, social customs, and traditional way of life."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.9.5", "8.5.1", "7.6.4"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain. As the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \u201cThey are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others.\u201d \nThe Vaishnava poet-saints of Maharashtra such as Jnaneshwar, Namadeva, Eknath and Tukaram were devotees of lord Vitthala. Devotion around lord Vitthala gave rise to the Varkari sect which lay emphasis on an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur. The cult of Vitthala emerged as a powerful mode of devotion and was very popular amongst the people. \nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant Tukaram: He who identifies with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart He treats A slave As his own son Says Tuka I won\u2019t be tired to repeat again Such a man Is God In person. Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela\u2019s son: You made us low caste, Why don\u2019t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life \u2013 left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this. You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha\u2019s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Closer Look \n\n Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders. The Kols rebelled in 1831-32, Santhals rose in revolt in 1855, the Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910 and the Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940. The movement that Birsa led was one such movement. \nBirsa Munda \n Birsa was born in the mid-1870s. The son of a poor father, he grew up around the forests of Bohonda, grazing sheep, playing the flute, and dancing in the local akhara. Forced by poverty, his father had to move from place to place looking for work. As an adolescent, Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw the sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt. They talked of a golden age when the Mundas had been free of the oppression of dikus, and said there would be a time when the ancestral right of the community would be restored. They saw themselves as the descendants of the original settlers of the region, fighting for their land (mulk ki larai), reminding people of the need to win back their kingdom. \nBirsa went to the local missionary school, and listened to the sermons of missionaries. There too he heard it said that it was possible for the Mundas to attain the Kingdom of Heaven, and regain their lost rights. This would be possible if they became good Christians and gave up their \u201cbad practices\u201d. Later Birsa also spent some time in the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread, and began to value the importance of purity and piety. \nBirsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch with in his growing-up years. His movement was aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. But we must remember that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords. He saw them as outside forces that were ruining the Munda way of life. \nVaishnav \u2013 Worshippers of Vishnu. \nIn 1895 Birsa urged his followers to recover their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past \u2013 a satyug (the age of truth) \u2013 when Mundas lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa also wanted people to once again work on their land, settle down and cultivate their fields. \nWhat worried British officials most was the political aim of the Birsa movement, for it wanted to drive out missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government and set up a Munda Raj with Birsa at its head. The movement identified all these forces as the cause of the misery the Mundas were suffering. \nThe land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system, Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land, and missionaries were criticising their traditional culture. As the movement spread the British officials decided to act. They arrested Birsa in 1895, convicted him on charges of rioting and jailed him for two years. \nWhen Birsa was released in 1897 he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy \u201cRavana\u201d (dikus and the Europeans) and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa\u2019s followers began targeting the symbols of diku and European power. They attacked police stations and churches, and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj. \nIn 1900 Birsa died of cholera and the movement faded out. However, the movement was significant in at least two ways. First \u2013 it forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not be easily taken over by dikus. Second \u2013 it showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou may have seen people perform rituals of worship, or singing bhajans, kirtans or qawwalis, or even repeating the name of God in silence, and noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various kinds of bhakti and Sufi movements that have evolved since the eighth century. \nThe number of Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s followers increased through the sixteenth century under his successors. They belonged to a number of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and craftsmen predominated. This may have something to do with Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s insistence that his followers must be householders and should adopt productive and useful occupations. They were also expected to contribute to the general funds of the community of followers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nSome towns like Ahmedabad (Gujarat) went on to become major commercial cities but others like Thanjavur shrank in size and importance over the centuries. Murshidabad (West Bengal) on the banks of the Bhagirathi, which rose to prominence as a centre for silks and became the capital of Bengal in 1704, declined in the course of the century as the weavers faced competition from cheap mill-made cloth from England. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThere were many kinds of traders. These included the Banjaras (see also Chapter 7). Several traders, especially horse traders, formed associations, with headmen who negotiated on their behalf with warriors who bought horses. \nSince traders had to pass through many kingdoms and forests, they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests. There were several such guilds in south India from the eighth century onwards \u2013 the most famous being the Manigramam and Nanadesi. These guilds traded extensively both within the peninsula and with Southeast Asia and China. \nThere were also communities like the Chettiars and the Marwari Oswal who went on to become the principal trading groups of the country. Gujarati traders, including the communities of Hindu Baniyas and Muslim Bohras, traded extensively with the ports of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, East Africa, Southeast Asia and China. They sold textiles and spices in these ports and, in exchange, brought gold and ivory from Africa; and spices, tin, Chinese blue pottery and silver from Southeast Asia and China. \nThe towns on the west coast were home to Arab, Persian, Chinese, Jewish and Syrian Christian traders. Indian spices and cloth sold in the Red Sea ports were purchased by Italian traders and eventually reached European markets, fetching very high profits. Spices grown in tropical climates (pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried ginger, etc.) became an important part of European cooking, and cotton cloth was very attractive. This eventually drew European traders to India. We will shortly read about how this changed the face of trading and towns. \nWith its rugged, mountainous landscape, Kabul (in present-day Afghanistan) became politically and commercially important from the sixteenth century onwards. Kabul and Qandahar were linked to the celebrated Silk Route. Besides, trade in horses was primarily carried on through this route. In the seventeenth century Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a diamond merchant, estimated that the horse trade at Kabul amounted to Rs 30,000 annually, which was a huge sum in those days. Camels carried dried fruits, dates, carpets, silks and even fresh fruits from Kabul to the subcontinent and elsewhere. Slaves were also brought here for sale. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for tribal groups to rebel in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and what were the specific political objectives of the Birsa Munda movement?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states in the 'A Closer Look' section that tribal groups rebelled against 'changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders.'

He felt that just as a father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the teachings of the Buddha (Chapter 7). \nThere were a number of problems that troubled him. People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Animals were sacrificed. Slaves and servants were ill treated. Besides, there were quarrels in families and amongst neighbours. Ashoka felt it was his duty to solve these problems. So, he appointed officials, known as the dhamma mahamatta who went from place to place teaching people about dhamma. Besides, Ashoka got his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars, instructing his officials to read his message to those who could not read it themselves. \nAshoka also sent messengers to spread ideas about dhamma to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece and Sri Lanka. Try and identify these on Map 6, pages 84-85. He built roads, dug wells, and built rest houses. Besides, he arranged for medical treatment for both human beings and animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nTake a look at Maps 1 and 2. Map 1 was made in 1154 CE by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi. The section reproduced here is a detail of the Indian subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The two maps are quite different even though they are of the same area. In al-Idrisi\u2019s map, south India is where we would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the island at the top. Place-names are marked in Arabic, and there are some well-known names like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (spelt in the map as Qanauj). Map 2 was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during which time information about the subcontinent had changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly detailed. This map was used by European sailors and merchants on their voyages (see Chapter 6). \nEqually important is the fact that the science of cartography differed in the two periods. When historians read documents, maps and texts from the past they have to be sensitive to the different historical backgrounds \u2013 the contexts \u2013 in which information about the past was produced. \nCartographer - A person who makes maps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe kings and kingdoms you have been reading about could not have existed without the support of flourishing villages.

As the rebellion spread, ryots refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen implements. Those who worked for the planters were socially boycotted, and the gomasthas \u2013 agents of planters \u2013 who came to collect rent were beaten up. Ryots swore they would no longer take advances to sow indigo nor be bullied by the planters\u2019 lathiyals \u2013 the lathi-wielding strongmen maintained by the planters. \nWhy did the indigo peasants decide that they would no longer remain silent? What gave them the power to rebel? Clearly, the indigo system was intensely oppressive. But those who are oppressed do not always rise up in rebellion. They do so only at times. In 1859, the indigo ryots felt that they had the support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters. In many villages, headmen who had been forced to sign indigo contracts, mobilised the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. These zamindars were unhappy with the increasing power of the planters and angry at being forced by the planters to give them land on long leases. \nThe indigo peasants also imagined that the British government would support them in their struggle against the planters. After the Revolt of 1857 the British government was particularly worried about the possibility of another popular rebellion. When the news spread of a simmering revolt in the indigo districts, the Lieutenant Governor toured the region in the winter of 1859. The ryots saw the tour as a sign of government sympathy for their plight. When in Barasat, the magistrate Ashley Eden issued a notice stating that ryots would not be compelled to accept indigo contracts, word went around that Queen Victoria had declared that indigo need not be sown. Eden was trying to placate the peasants and control an explosive situation, but his action was read as support for the rebellion. \nAs the rebellion spread, intellectuals from Calcutta rushed to the indigo districts. They wrote of the misery of the ryots, the tyranny of the planters, and the horrors of the indigo system. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty, and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. \nAfter the revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal. But the planters now shifted their operation to Bihar. With the discovery of synthetic dyes in the late nineteenth century their business was severely affected, but yet they managed to expand production. When Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa, a peasant from Bihar persuaded him to visit Champaran and see the plight of the indigo cultivators there. Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s visit in 1917 marked the beginning of the Champaran movement against the indigo planters. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nAs the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors emboldened the indigo ryots to launch the \"Blue Rebellion\" in 1859, and what were the immediate outcomes of this revolt?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text section titled \"The 'Blue Rebellion' and After\" explicitly details the reasons behind the indigo ryots' rebellion and its immediate consequences.

The second text section discusses the Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram, established in the \"ninth century\" in the \"south-western part of the peninsula, part of present-day Kerala\". It highlights that rulers introduced the \"Malayalam language and script in their inscriptions,\" marking it as \"one of the earliest examples of the use of a regional language in official records in the subcontinent.\" It also mentions that the \"first literary works in Malayalam, dated to about the twelfth century,\" were indebted to Sanskrit. This development of Malayalam serves as the second example.\n3. The answer combines these two distinct examples, specifying their age and region as requested.\n\nAnswer: One example is Sangam literature, early Tamil works composed around 2300 years ago, primarily associated with assemblies of poets in Madurai. Another example is the development of the Malayalam language in the Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram, in present-day Kerala, where rulers introduced its script in official inscriptions in the ninth century, marking one of the earliest uses of a regional language in official records. The first literary works in Malayalam appeared around the twelfth century."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.9.4", "7.9.2", "6.12.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nQazi \u2013 A judge \n Mufti \u2013 A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer \n Impeachment \u2013 A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons \n Dharmashastras \u2013 Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 BCE onwards \n Sawar \u2013 Men on horses \n Musket \u2013 A heavy gun used by infantry soldiers \n Matchlock \u2013 An early type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match \nSetting up a New Administration \n\n Warren Hastings (Governor-General from 1773 to 1785) was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts \u2013 a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat ). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors. \nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta. \nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. His office \u2013 the Collectorate \u2013 became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. \nThe Company army \n Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. \nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry requirements of the Company\u2019s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of the Company\u2019s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century the British began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nEmperors need more resources than kings because empires are larger than kingdoms, and need to be protected by big armies.

Today, we describe them as hunter-gatherers. The name comes from the way in which they got their food. Generally, they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks and eggs. The immense variety of plants in a tropical land like ours meant that gathering plant produce was an extremely important means of obtaining food. \nNone of these things was easy to do. There are several animals that run faster than us, many that are stronger. To hunt animals or catch fish and birds, people need to be alert, quick, and have lots of presence of mind. To collect plant produce, you need to find out which plants or parts of plants are edible, that is, can be eaten, as many can be poisonous. You also need to find out about the seasons when the fruits ripen. \nThere are at least four reasons why huntergatherers moved from place to place. First, if they had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would have had to go elsewhere in search of food. Second, animals move from place to place \u2014 either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. That is why those who hunted them had to follow their movements. Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons. So, people may have moved from season to season in search of different kinds of plants. Fourth, people, plants and animals need water to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial (with water throughout the year) others are seasonal. People living on their banks would have had to go in search of water during the dry seasons (winter and summer). Besides, people may have travelled to meet their friends and relatives. Remember, they travelled on foot. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Magadha on Map 4 (page 57). Magadha became the most important mahajanapada in about two hundred years. Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies (c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest, could be captured and trained for the army. Forests also provided wood for building houses, carts and chariots. Besides, there were iron ore mines in the region that could be tapped to make strong tools and weapons. \nMagadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara and Ajatasattu, who used all possible means to conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma Nanda was another important ruler. He extended his control up to the north-west part of the subcontinent. Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in Bihar was the capital of Magadha for several years. Later the capital was shifted to Pataliputra (present-day Patna). \nMore than 2300 years ago, a ruler named Alexander, who lived in Macedonia in Europe, wanted to become a world conqueror. Of course, he didn\u2019t conquer the world, but did conquer parts of Egypt and West Asia, and came to the Indian subcontinent, reaching up to the banks of the Beas. When he wanted to march further eastwards, his soldiers refused. They were scared, as they had heard that the rulers of India had vast armies of foot soldiers, chariots and elephants.More than 2300 years ago, a ruler named Alexander, who lived in Macedonia in Europe, wanted to become a world conqueror.

They moved if they \"had stayed at one place for a long time, they would have eaten up all the available plant and animal resources.\" They also followed \"animals [that] move from place to place\" and moved seasonally because \"plants and trees bear fruit in different seasons.\" Furthermore, the need for \"water to survive\" from seasonal rivers and lakes during dry seasons compelled them to move. This clearly shows how natural resources (food, water) and environmental conditions (seasonality, animal movement) dictated their nomadic lifestyle.\n2.  **Magadha:** The second section explains how Magadha's natural resources and environment contributed to its power. \"Many rivers such as the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha,\" which was important for \"transport, water supplies (c) making the land fertile.\" \"Parts of Magadha were forested,\" providing \"Elephants\" for the army and \"wood for building houses, carts and chariots.\" Additionally, \"iron ore mines in the region\" could be used to make \"strong tools and weapons.\" These resources directly supported its military, infrastructure, and agriculture, enabling its rise as a powerful mahajanapada.\n\nAnswer: Natural resources and environmental conditions shaped hunter-gatherer lifestyles by providing diverse plant and animal food sources, but also necessitated their movement due to resource depletion, animal migration, seasonal plant availability, and the need for water from seasonal sources. For Magadha, rivers provided transport, water, and fertile land, forests supplied elephants for the army and wood for construction, and iron ore mines offered materials for strong tools and weapons, all of which were crucial for its rise to power."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.2.1", "6.6.7"], "num_distractors": 0}}

It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum Zinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in November 1862. \nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the rebellion died down after that. People continued to resist and battle the British. The British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. Lucknow was taken in March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate awaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, chose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on all sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India and continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of many tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried and killed in April 1859. \nJust as victories against the British had earlier encouraged rebellion, the defeat of rebel forces encouraged desertions. The British also tried their best to win back the loyalty of the people. They announced rewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British, and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied.

Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans.

These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHampi is located in the Krishna-Tungabhadra basin, which formed the nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336. The magnificent ruins at Hampi reveal a well-fortified city. No mortar or cementing agent was used in the construction of these walls and the technique followed was to wedge them together by interlocking. \nThis is how a Portuguese traveller, Domingo Paes, described Hampi in the sixteenth century: \u2026 at the entrance of the gate where those pass who come from Goa, this king has made within it a very strong city fortified with walls and towers; these walls are not like those of other cities, but are made of very strong masonry such as would be found in few other parts, and inside very beautiful rows of buildings made after their manner with flat roofs. \nDuring their rule, the Vijaynagara rulers took keen interest in building tanks and canals. The Anantraj Sagar Tank was built with a 1.37 km. long earthern dam across the Maldevi river. Krishnadeva Raya built a huge stone embankment between two hills to create a massive lake near Vijayanagara, from which water was carried through aqueducts and channels to irrigate fields and gardens. \nThe architecture of Hampi was distinctive. The buildings in the royal complex had splendid arches, domes and pillared halls with niches for holding sculptures. They also had well-planned orchards and pleasure gardens with sculptural motifs such as the lotus and corbels. In its heyday in the fifteenthsixteenth centuries, Hampi bustled with commercial and cultural activities. Muslim merchants, Chettis and agents of European traders such as the Portuguese, thronged the markets of Hampi. \nTemples were the hub of cultural activities and devadasis (temple dancers) performed before the deity, royalty and masses in the many-pillared halls in the Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) temple. The Mahanavami festival, known today as Navaratri in the south, was one of the most important festivals celebrated at Hampi. Archaeologists have found the Mahanavami platform where the king received guests and accepted tribute from subordinate chiefs. From here he also watched dance and music performances as well as wrestling bouts. Hampi fell into ruin following the defeat of Vijayanagara in 1565 by the Deccani Sultans \u2013 the rulers of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar and Bidar. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nIf you plant a seed, you will notice that it takes some time to grow.

When people began growing plants, it meant that they had to stay in the same place for a long time looking after the plants, watering, weeding, driving away animals and birds \u2014 till the grain ripened. And then, the grain had to be used carefully. \nAs grain had to be stored for both food and seed, people had to think of ways of storing it. In many areas, they began making large clay pots, or wove baskets, or dug pits into the ground. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArvind was supposed to be acting as Samudragupta, a famous ruler of a dynasty known as the Guptas.

The Mahanavami festival was also crucial, involving the king receiving guests, tribute, and watching dance, music, and wrestling performances. Hampi also had significant commercial activities. The Puranas, containing stories about gods, goddesses, worship, world creation, and kings, were written in simple Sanskrit verse to be heard by everyone, including women and shudras, and were recited by priests in temples.

His brothers were each given a province. The ambitions of his brother Mirza Kamran weakened Humayun\u2019s cause against Afghan competitors. Sher Khan defeated Humayun at Chausa (1539) and Kanauj (1540), forcing him to flee to Iran. (2) In Iran Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah. He recaptured Delhi in 1555 but died the next year after an accident in this building. \nAKBAR 1556-1605 : Akbar was 13 years old when he became emperor. His reign can be divided into three periods. (1) 1556-1570 \u2013 Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan and other members of his domestic staff. Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed. Prince Khurram, the future Emperor Shah Jahan, rebelled in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir\u2019s wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful. \nShah Jahan 1627-1658 : Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar; the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids. In 1632 Ahmadnagar was finally annexed and the Bijapur forces sued for peace. In 1657-1658, there was conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan\u2019s sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra. \nAurangzeb 1658-1707 : (1) In the north-east, the Ahoms were defeated in 1663, but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas.

This one mentions Samudragupta\u2019s great grandfather, grandfather, father and mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. His great grandfather and grandfather are mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems as if the family gradually rose to importance. \nSamudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies (lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition to western India, where he overcame the last of the Shakas.

There is evidence that fruits such as ber, amla, jamun, dates and a variety of berries were collected. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe often take the use of iron for granted today. Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of our daily lives. The use of iron began in the subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the largest collections of iron tools and weapons were found in the megalithic burials, about which you read in Chapter 5. \nAround 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the growing use of iron tools. These included axes for clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we had seen (Chapter 6) the ploughshare was useful for increasing agricultural production. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have given lengthy names for the time that we are studying. They call the earliest period the Palaeolithic. This comes from two Greek words, \u2018palaeo\u2019, meaning old, and \u2018lithos\u2019, meaning stone. The name points to the importance of finds of stone tools. The Palaeolithic period extends from 2 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago. This long stretch of time is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This long span of time covers 99% of human history. \nThe period when we find environmental changes, beginning about 12,000 years ago till about 10,000 years ago is called the Mesolithic (middle stone). Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are called microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or wood to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older varieties of tools continued to be in use. \nThe next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nLet us look at some of the objects that were made and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things that have been found by archaeologists are made of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels. \nGeneralPerhaps the most striking finds are those of beads, weights, and blades.ly \nThe Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular (See illustration on page 35) and usually have an animal carved on them. \nThe Harappans also made pots with beautiful black designs, such as the one shown on page 6. \nCotton was probably grown at Mehrgarh from about 7000 years ago. Actual pieces of cloth were found attached to the lid of a silver vase and some copper objects at Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists have also found spindle whorls, made of terracotta and faience. These were used to spin thread. \nMany of the things that were produced were probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a person who is trained to do only one kind of work, for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 36) and see how well the face is carved and how carefully the beard is shown. This must have been the work of an expert crafts person. \nNot everybody could have been a specialist. We do not know whether only men were specialists or only women were specialists.

The only time they stayed in one place was during the rainy season, when it was very difficult to travel. Then, their supporters built temporary shelters for them in gardens, or they lived in natural caves in hilly areas. \nAs time went on, many supporters of the monks and nuns, and they themselves, felt the need for more permanent shelters and so monasteries were built. These were known as viharas. The earliest viharas were made of wood, and then of brick. Some were even in caves that were dug out in hills, especially in western India. \nVery often, the land on which the vihara was built was donated by a rich merchant or a landowner, or the king. The local people came with gifts of food, clothing and medicines for the monks and nuns. In return, they taught the people. Over the centuries, Buddhism spread to many parts of the subcontinent and beyond. You will learn more about this in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe organisation of the Sikhs into a political community during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 8) helped in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda Bahadur\u2019s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh, and established their own administration between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716. \nUnder a number of able leaders in the eighteenth century, the Sikhs organized themselves into a number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. Their combined forces were known as the grand army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to take collective decisions known as \u201cresolutions of the Guru (gurmatas)\u201d. A system called rakhi was introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. \nGuru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega khalsa). Their well-knit organization enabled them to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa declared their sovereign rule by striking their own coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the same inscription as the one on the orders issued by the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur. \nThe Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they were divided under different rulers. One of them, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and established his capital at Lahore in 1799. \nTowards the end of the 17th century a powerful state started emerging in the Deccan under the leadership of Shivaji which finally led to the establishment of the Maratha state. Shivaji was born to Shahji and Jija Bai at Shivneri in 1630. Under the guidance of his mother and his guardian Dada Konddev, Shivaji embarked on a career of conquest at a young age. The occupation of Javli made him the undisputed leader of the Mavala highlands which paved the way for further expansion. His exploits against the forces of Bijapur and the Mughals made him a legendary figure. He often resorted to guerrilla warfare against his opponents. By introducing an efficient administrative system supported by a revenue collection method based on chauth and sardeshmukhi he laid the foundations of a strong Maratha state. \nThe Maratha kingdom was another powerful regional kingdom to arise out of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji (1627-1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). Groups of highly mobile, peasantpastoralists (kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji\u2019s death, effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji\u2019s successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona became the capital of the Maratha kingdom. \nBaji Rao I, also known as Baji Rao Ballal was the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath. He was a great Maratha general who is credited to have expanded the Maratha kingdom beyond the Vindhyas and is known for his military campaigns against Malwa, Bundelkhand, Gujarat and the Portugese. \nUnder the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very successful military organisation. Their success lay in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas where their supply lines and reinforcements could be easily disturbed. \nBetween 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region. \nChauth : 25 per cent of the land revenue claimed by zamindars. In the Deccan this was collected by the Marathas. Sardeshmukhi : 9-10 per cent of the land revenue paid to the head revenue collector in the Deccan. \nAfter raiding Delhi in 1737 the frontiers of Maratha domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu countries in the south (see Map 1). These were not formally included in the Maratha empire, but were made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, but it came at a price. These military campaigns also made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas during the third battle of Panipat in 1761. \nAlongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas developed an effective administrative system as well. Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under Sindhia\u2019s patronage and Indore under Holkar\u2019s. By all accounts these cities were large and prosperous and functioned as important commercial and cultural centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier participated in the trade between Agra and Surat now expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur in the south and Lucknow and Allahabad in the east. \nLike the other states the Jats consolidated their power during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, and by the 1680s they had begun dominating the region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and Agra. For a while they became the virtual custodians of the city of Agra. \nThe power of the Jats reached its zenith under Suraj Mal who consolidated the Jat state at Bharatpur (in present day Rajasthan) during 1756-1763. The areas under the political control of Suraj Mal broadly included parts of modern eastern Rajasthan, southern Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Suraj Mal built a number of forts and palaces and the famous Lohagarh fort in Bharatpur is regarded as one of the strongest forts built in this region. \nThe Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, many of the city\u2019s notables took refuge there. His son Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to fight the Mughals. \nWhile the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first associated with royalty under Shah Jahan (see Figure 12 in Chapter 5 and Figure 12 in Chapter 9). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What architectural styles influenced the construction of the elaborate garden palace at Dig by the Jats, and to whom were these forms first associated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'at Dig the Jats built an elaborate garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra.'

Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen that inscriptions are inscribed on hard surfaces. Many of these were inscribed several hundreds of years ago. All inscriptions contain both scripts and languages. Languages which were used, as well as scripts, have changed over time. So how do scholars understand what was inscribed? This can be done through a process known as decipherment \nOne of the most famous stories of decipherment comes from Egypt, a country in north Africa where there were kings and queens about 5000 years ago. \nRosetta is a town on the north coast of Egypt, and here an inscribed stone was found, which contained inscriptions in three different languages and scripts (Greek, and two forms of Egyptian). Scholars who could read Greek figured out that the names of kings and queens were enclosed in a little frame, called a cartouche. They then placed the Greek and the Egyptian signs side by side, and identified the sounds for which the Egyptian letters stood. As you can see, a lion stood for L, and a bird for A. Once they knew what the letters stood for, they could read other inscriptions as well. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here. At some sites, a large number of tools, used for all sorts of activities, were found. These were probably habitation-cum factory sites. In some of the other, smaller sites, there is evidence to suggest that tools were made. Some of the sites were close to springs. Most tools were made from limestone, which was locally available \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What architectural styles and technological advancements were developed to facilitate the construction of large and elaborate structures like temples and stepwells, and how did these innovations manifest in specific historical examples?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text details several architectural styles and technological advancements. The 'trabeate' or 'corbelled' style, which involved placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns for roofs, doors, and windows, was used between the seventh and tenth centuries and applied to temples, mosques, tombs, and baolis between the eighth and thirteenth centuries (Section 3). From the twelfth century, two major developments emerged: the 'arcuate' architectural form, where arches carried the weight of the superstructure above doors and windows, and the increasing use of high-quality 'limestone cement,' which, when mixed with stone chips, hardened into concrete, making construction faster and easier (Section 3). These innovations are exemplified by specific structures: the Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur required architects to build an inclined path over 4 km long to roll a 90-tonne stone to the top of its shikhara, as manual lifting was impossible (Section 3). The Kandariya Mahadeva temple, built in 999, showcases an elaborate design with an ornamented gateway, a main hall (mahamandapa), and a main shrine (garbhagriha), adorned with intricately carved sculptures (Section 3). Lastly, the Raniji ki baori, constructed in 1699 C.E., is highlighted as the largest of its kind and known for its architectural beauty, illustrating the application of these skills to large stepwells (Section 3).\n\nAnswer: To facilitate the construction of large and elaborate structures, architects developed the 'trabeate' or 'corbelled' style, which involved placing horizontal beams across vertical columns. From the twelfth century, the 'arcuate' style emerged, utilizing arches to support superstructures, alongside the adoption of high-quality limestone cement that hardened into concrete, making construction easier and faster. These innovations are evident in the Rajarajeshvara temple, where an inclined path was engineered to position a 90-tonne stone on its shikhara.

Smaller castes, or jatis, emerged within varnas. For example, new castes appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis. Specialised artisans \u2013 smiths, carpenters and masons \u2013 were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas. Jatis, rather than varna, became the basis for organising society. \nA twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of Brahmanas. They deliberated on the status of a group known as rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down their occupations, which were to include architecture, building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways for temples with images in them, preparing wooden equipment used to perform sacrifices, building mandapas, making jewels for the king. \nAmong the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a developed society was emerging, and rulers used their wealth to create powerful states. \nThe rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society. On the other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was not widely accepted in these areas. The emergence of states is closely related to social change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this important part of our history are described below. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What factors led to the emergence of jatis as the primary basis for organizing society, and how were various new groups, including specialized artisans and tribal communities, incorporated into this evolving social structure?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that jatis emerged because 'As the economy and the needs of society grew, people with new skills were required.'

The English, Dutch and French formed East India Companies in order to expand their commercial activities in the east. Initially great Indian traders like Mulla Abdul Ghafur and Virji Vora who owned a large number of ships competed with them. However, the European Companies used their naval power to gain control of the sea trade and forced Indian traders to work as their agents. Ultimately, the English emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent. \nThe spurt in demand for goods like textiles led to a great expansion of the crafts of spinning, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, etc. with more and more people taking them up. Indian textile designs became increasingly refined. However, this period also saw the decline of the independence of craftspersons. They now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to European agents. Weavers no longer had the liberty of selling their own cloth or weaving their own patterns. They had to reproduce the designs supplied to them by the Company agents. \nThe eighteenth century saw the rise of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, which are nodal cities today.

A few exceptions apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These were passed down to each new generation. Presentday historians have started using such oral traditions to write tribal histories. \nTribal people were found in almost every region of the subcontinent. The area and influence of a tribe varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar tribe was very influential during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, was made a noble (mansabdar) by Emperor Akbar. In Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated extensive regions before they were subdued by the Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was entirely dominated by tribes \u2013 the Nagas, Ahoms and many others. \nIn many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. Raja Man Singh, Akbar\u2019s famous general, attacked and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The Mundas and Santals were among the other important tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa and Bengal. \nClan : A clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor. Tribal organisation is often based on kinship or clan loyalties. \nThe Maharashtra highlands and Karnataka were home to Kolis, Berads and numerous others. Kolis also lived in many areas of Gujarat. Further south there were large tribal populations of Koragas, Vetars, Maravars and many others. \nThe large tribe of Bhils was spread across western and central India. By the late sixteenth century, many of them had become settled agriculturists and some even zamindars. Many Bhil clans, nevertheless, remained huntergatherers. The Gonds were found in great numbers across the present-day states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nConsiderable social change took place in the subcontinent during the period we have been examining. Varna-based society and tribal people constantly interacted with each other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies to adapt and change. There were many different tribes and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of time, many of them merged with castebased society. Others, however, rejected both the caste system and orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive states with well-organised systems of administration. They thus became politically powerful. This brought them into conflict with larger and more complex kingdoms and empires. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nFrom the eighth century onwards the subcontinent was dotted with several small towns. These probably emerged from large villages. They usually had a mandapika (or mandi of later times) to which nearby villagers brought their produce to sell. They also had market streets called hatta (haat of later times) lined with shops. Besides, there were streets for different kinds of artisans such as potters, oil pressers, sugar makers, toddy makers, smiths, stonemasons, etc. While some traders lived in the town, others travelled from town to town. Many came from far and near to these towns to buy local articles and sell products of distant places like horses, salt, camphor, saffron, betel nut and spices like pepper. \nUsually a samanta or, in later times, a zamindar built a fortified palace in or near these towns. They levied taxes on traders, artisans and articles of trade and sometimes \u201cdonated\u201d the \u201cright\u201d to collect these taxes to local temples, which had been built by themselves or by rich merchants. These \u201crights\u201d were recorded in inscriptions that have survived to this day. \nThe following is a summary from a tenth-century inscription from Rajasthan, which lists the dues that were to be collected by temple authorities: There were taxes in kind on: Sugar and jaggery, dyes, thread, and cotton, On coconuts, salt, areca nuts, butter, sesame oil, On cloth. Besides, there were taxes on traders, on those who sold metal goods, on distillers, on oil, on cattle fodder, and on loads of grain.

Traders, both local and those travelling from town to town, facilitated the exchange of local articles and products from distant places like horses, salt, and spices. Samantas or zamindars built fortified palaces and levied taxes on traders, artisans, and articles of trade.

Military campaigns were launched against the Suris and other Afghans, against the neighbouring kingdoms of Malwa and Gondwana, and to suppress the revolt of his half-brother Mirza Hakim and the Uzbegs. In 1568 the Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized and in 1569 Ranthambhor. (2) 1570-1585 \u2013 military campaigns in Gujarat were followed by campaigns in the east in Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim. (3) 1585-1605 \u2013 expansion of Akbar\u2019s empire. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized from the Safavids, Kashmir was annexed, as also Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Campaigns in the Deccan started and Berar, Khandesh and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign Akbar was distracted by the rebellion of Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. \nJahangir 1605-1627 : Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Less successful campaigns against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar followed.

Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar led to their rebellion. Campaigns against the Maratha chieftain Shivaji were initially successful. But Aurangzeb insulted Shivaji who escaped from Agra, declared himself an independent king and resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran. (2) After Akbar\u2019s rebellion Aurangzeb sent armies against the Deccan Sultanates. Bijapur was annexed in 1685 and Golconda in 1687. From 1698 Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas who started guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb also had to face the rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas. His death was followed by a succession conflict amongst his sons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAshoka\u2019s dhamma did not involve worship of a god, or performance of a sacrifice. He felt that just as a father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the teachings of the Buddha (Chapter 7). \nThere were a number of problems that troubled him. People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Animals were sacrificed. Slaves and servants were ill treated. Besides, there were quarrels in families and amongst neighbours. Ashoka felt it was his duty to solve these problems. So, he appointed officials, known as the dhamma mahamatta who went from place to place teaching people about dhamma. Besides, Ashoka got his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars, instructing his officials to read his message to those who could not read it themselves. \nAshoka also sent messengers to spread ideas about dhamma to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece and Sri Lanka. Try and identify these on Map 6, pages 84-85. He built roads, dug wells, and built rest houses. Besides, he arranged for medical treatment for both human beings and animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role. These included the spread of agriculture and the growth of new towns, craft production and trade. Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new buildings were built \u2014 including the earliest temples and stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were made. These developments took place simultaneously, i.e. at the same time. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of the book. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArchaeologists have found traces of huts or houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom (in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, which were dug into the ground, with steps leading into them. These may have provided shelter in cold weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking hearths both inside and outside the huts, which suggests that, depending on the weather, people could cook food either indoors or outdoors. \nStone tools have been found from many sites as well. Many of these are different from the earlier Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles used for grinding grain and other plant produce. Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain even today, several thousand years later. At the same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued to be made and used, and remember, some tools were also made of bone. \nMany kinds of earthen pots have also been found. These were sometimes decorated, and were used for storing things. People began using pots for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat and lentils that now became an important part of the diet. Besides, they began weaving cloth, using different kinds of materials, for example cotton, that could now be grown. \nDid things change everywhere and all at once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women still continued to hunt and gather food, and elsewhere people adopted farming and herding slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, in some cases people tried to combine these activities, doing different things during different seasons.imals \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what were the primary methods employed by Emperor Ashoka to govern his subjects and spread his ideology, and how did these methods differ from the typical actions of the Mughal emperors described?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The 'Ashoka\u2019s dhamma' section outlines Emperor Ashoka's methods for governance and ideological spread. He believed it was his duty to instruct his subjects, inspired by the teachings of the Buddha. To achieve this, he appointed officials known as 'dhamma mahamatta' to travel and teach people about dhamma. He also had his messages inscribed on rocks and pillars and sent messengers to spread these ideas to other lands, such as Syria, Egypt, Greece, and Sri Lanka. Furthermore, Ashoka engaged in public welfare by building roads, digging wells, building rest houses, and arranging medical treatment for both human beings and animals, all aimed at solving problems like conflict, animal sacrifice, and ill-treatment.\n\nIn contrast, the 'Mughal Emperors' section primarily describes the actions of rulers like Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb through military means.

The text consistently highlights their expansionist and power-consolidating military endeavors.\n\nThus, Ashoka's methods focused on moral instruction, social welfare, and the peaceful propagation of an ideology, whereas the Mughal emperors' actions were predominantly characterized by military conquest, territorial expansion, and the forceful suppression of opposition.\n\nAnswer: Emperor Ashoka's primary methods involved moral instruction, social welfare, and the peaceful propagation of his dhamma through appointed officials ('dhamma mahamatta'), inscribed messages on rocks and pillars, and messengers sent to other lands.

However, in spite of such claims, they often shared power with their samantas as well as with associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas. \nIn each of these states, resources were obtained from the producers \u2013 that is, peasants, cattle-keepers, artisans \u2013 who were often persuaded or compelled to surrender part of what they produced. Sometimes these were claimed as \u201crent\u201d due to a lord who asserted that he owned the land. Revenue was also collected from traders. \nThe inscriptions of the Cholas who ruled in Tamil Nadu refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds of taxes. The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti, taken not in cash but in the form of forced labour, and kadamai, or land revenue. There were also taxes on thatching the house, the use of a ladder to climb palm trees, a cess on succession to family property, etc. \nThese resources were used to finance the king\u2019s establishment, as well as for the construction of temples and forts. They were also used to fight wars, which were in turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes. \nThe functionaries for collecting revenue were generally recruited from influential families, and positions were often hereditary. This was true about the army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the king held these positions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Ajanta on Map 7 (page 113). This is a place where several caves were hollowed out of the hills over centuries. Most of these were monasteries for Buddhist monks, and some of them were decorated with paintings. Here are some examples. As the caves are dark inside, most of these paintings were done in the light of torches. The colours, which are vivid even after 1500 years, were made of plants and minerals. The artists who created these splendid works of art remain unknown. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nCaste and Social Reform \n\n Some of the social reformers we have been discussing also criticised caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy translated an old Buddhist text that was critical of caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of Bhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes. In Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in 1840 to work for the abolition of caste. Many of these reformers and members of reform associations were people of upper castes. Often, in secret meetings, these reformers would violate caste taboos on food and touch, in an effort to get rid of the hold of caste prejudice in their lives. \nThere were also others who questioned the injustices of the caste social order. During the course of the nineteenth century, Christian missionaries began setting up schools for tribal groups and \u201clower\u201d-caste children. These children were thus equipped with some resources to make their way into a changing world. \nAt the same time, the poor began leaving their villages to look for jobs that were opening up in the cities. There was work in the factories that were coming up, and jobs in municipalities. You have read about the expansion of cities in Chapter 6. Think of the new demands of labour this created. Drains had to be dug, roads laid, buildings constructed, and cities cleaned. This required coolies, diggers, carriers, bricklayers, sewage cleaners, sweepers, palanquin bearers, rickshaw pullers. Where did this labour come from? The poor from the villages and small towns, many of them from low castes, began moving to the cities where there was a new demand for labour. Some also went to work in plantations in Assam, Mauritius, Trinidad and Indonesia. Work in the new locations was often very hard. But the poor, the people from low castes, saw this as an opportunity to get away from the oppressive hold that upper-caste landowners exercised over their lives and the daily humiliation they suffered. \nThere were other jobs too. The army, for instance, offered opportunities. A number of Mahar people, who were regarded as untouchable, found jobs in the Mahar Regiment. The father of B.R. Ambedkar, the leader of the Dalit movement, taught at an army school. \nDemands for equality and justice \n Gradually, by the second half of the nineteenth century, people from within the Non-Brahman castes began organising movements against caste discrimination, and demanded social equality and justice. \nThe Satnami movement in Central India was founded by Ghasidas who worked among the leatherworkers and organised a movement to improve their social status. In eastern Bengal, Haridas Thakur\u2019s Matua sect worked among Chandala cultivators. Haridas questioned Brahmanical texts that supported the caste system. In what is present-day Kerala, a guru from Ezhava caste, Shri Narayana Guru, proclaimed the ideals of unity for his people. He argued against treating people unequally on the basis of caste differences. According to him, all humankind belonged to the same caste. One of his famous statements was: \u201coru jati, oru matam, oru daivam manushyanu\u201d (one caste, one religion, one god for humankind). \nAll these sects were founded by leaders who came from Non-Brahman castes and worked amongst them. They tried to change those habits and practices which provoked the contempt of dominant castes. They tried to create a sense of self-esteem among the subordinate castes. \nGulamgiri \n One of the most vocal amongst the \u201clow-caste\u201d leaders was Jyotirao Phule. Born in 1827, he studied in schools set up by Christian missionaries. On growing up he developed his own ideas about the injustices of caste society. He set out to attack the Brahmans\u2019 claim that they were superior to others, since they were Aryans. Phule argued that the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside the subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true children of the country \u2013 those who had lived here from before the coming of the Aryans. As the Aryans established their dominance, they began looking at the defeated population as inferior, as low-caste people. According to Phule, the \u201cupper\u201d castes had no right to their land and power: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people, the so-called low castes. \nPhule claimed that before Aryan rule there existed a golden age when warrior-peasants tilled the land and ruled the Maratha countryside in just and fair ways. He proposed that Shudras (labouring castes) and Ati Shudras (untouchables) should unite to challenge caste discrimination. The Satyashodhak Samaj, an association Phule founded, propagated caste equality. \nIn 1873, Phule wrote a book named Gulamgiri, meaning slavery. Some ten years before this, the American Civil War had been fought, leading to the end of slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves, thus establishing a link between the conditions of the \u201clower\u201d castes in India and the black slaves in America. \nAs this example shows, Phule extended his criticism of the caste system to argue against all forms of inequality. He was concerned about the plight of \u201cupper\u201d-caste women, the miseries of the labourer, and the humiliation of the \u201clow\u201d castes. This movement for caste reform was continued in the twentieth century by other great dalit leaders like Dr B.R. Ambedkar in western India and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in the south. \nWho could enter temples? \n Ambedkar was born into a Mahar family. As a child he experienced what caste prejudice meant in everyday life. In school he was forced to sit outside the classroom on the ground, and was not allowed to drink water from taps that upper -caste children used. After finishing school, he got a fellowship to go to the US for higher studies. On his return to India in 1919, he wrote extensively about \u201cupper\u201d- caste power in contemporary society. \nIn 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry movement, in which his Mahar caste followers participated. Brahman priests were outraged when the Dalits used water from the temple tank. Ambedkar led three such movements for temple entry between 1927 and 1935. His aim was to make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society. \nThe Non-Brahman movement \n In the early twentieth century, the non-Brahman movement started. The initiative came from those non-Brahman castes that had acquired access to education, wealth and influence. They argued that Brahmans were heirs of Aryan invaders from the north who had conquered southern lands from the original inhabitants of the region \u2013 the indigenous Dravidian races. They also challenged Brahmanical claims to power. \nE.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, or Periyar, as he was called, came from a middle-class family. Interestingly, he had been an ascetic in his early life and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully. Later, he became a member of the Congress, only to leave it in disgust when he found that at a feast organised by nationalists, seating arrangements followed caste distinctions \u2013 that is, the lower castes were made to sit at a distance from the upper castes. Convinced that untouchables had to fight for their dignity, Periyar founded the Self Respect Movement. He argued that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt that all religious authorities saw social divisions and inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to free themselves, therefore, from all religions in order to achieve social equality. \nPeriyar was an outspoken critic of Hindu scriptures, especially the Codes of Manu, the ancient lawgiver, and the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana. He said that these texts had been used to establish the authority of Brahmans over lower castes and the domination of men over women. \nThese assertions did not go unchallenged. The forceful speeches, writings and movements of lower-caste leaders did lead to rethinking and some self-criticism among upper-caste nationalist leaders. But orthodox Hindu society also reacted by founding Sanatan Dharma Sabhas and the Bharat Dharma Mahamandal in the north, and associations like the Brahman Sabha in Bengal. The object of these associations was to uphold caste distinctions as a cornerstone of Hinduism, and show how this was sanctified by scriptures. Debates and struggles over caste continued beyond the colonial period and are still going on in our own times. \nOrganising for reform \n The Brahmo Samaj \n The Brahmo Samaj, formed in 1830, prohibited all forms of idolatry and sacrifice, believed in the Upanishads, and forbade its members from criticising other religious practices. It critically drew upon the ideals of religions \u2013 especially of Hinduism and Christianity \u2013 looking at their negative and positive dimensions. \nDerozio and Young Bengal \n Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, a teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, in the 1820s, promoted radical ideas and encouraged his pupils to question all authority. Referred to as the Young Bengal Movement, his students attacked tradition and custom, demanded education for women and campaigned for the freedom of thought and expression. \nThe Ramakrishna Mission and Swami Vivekananda \n Named after Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s guru, the Ramakrishna Mission stressed the ideal of salvation through social service and selfless action. \nSwami Vivekananda (1863-1902), whose original name was Narendra Nath Dutta, combined the simple teachings of Sri Ramakrishna with his well founded modern outlook and spread them all over the world. After hearing him in the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, the New York Herald reported, \u201cWe feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation\u201d. Indeed, Swami Vivekananda was the first Indian in modern times, who re-established the spiritual pre-eminence of the Vedanta philosophy on a global scale. But his mission was not simply to talk of religion. He was extremely pained at the poverty and the misery of his country men. He firmly believed that any reform could become successful only by uplifting the condition of the masses. Therefore, his clarion call to the people of India was to rise above the narrow confines of their \u2018religion of the kitchen\u2019 and come together in the service of the nation. By sending out this call he made a signal contribution to the nascent nationalism of India. His sense of nationalism was, however, not narrow in its conception. He was convinced that many of the problems facing the mankind could only be overcome if the nations of the world come together on an equal footing. Therefore, his exhortation to the youth was to unite on the basis of a common spiritual heritage. In this exhortation he became truly \u2018the symbol of a new spirit and a source of strength for the future\u2019. \nThe Prarthana Samaj \n Established in 1867 at Bombay, the Prarthana Samaj sought to remove caste restrictions, abolish child marriage, encourage the education of women, and end the ban on widow remarriage. Its religious meetings drew upon Hindu, Buddhist and Christian texts. \nThe Veda Samaj \n Established in Madras (Chennai) in 1864, the Veda Samaj was inspired by the Brahmo Samaj. It worked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women\u2019s education. Its members believed in one God. They condemned the superstitions and rituals of orthodox Hinduism. \nThe Aligarh Movement \n The Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, founded by Sayyid Ahmed Khan in 1875 at Aligarh, later became the Aligarh Muslim University. The institution offered modern education, including Western science, to Muslims. The Aligarh Movement, as it was known, had an enormous impact in the area of educational reform. \nThe Singh Sabha Movement \n Reform organisations of the Sikhs, the first Singh Sabhas were formed at Amritsar in 1873 and at Lahore in 1879. The Sabhas sought to rid Sikhism of superstitions, caste distinctions and practices seen by them as non-Sikh. They promoted education among the Sikhs, often combining modern instruction with Sikh teachings. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAs traders journeyed to distant lands in caravans and ships, pilgrims often travelled with them. Pilgrims are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to offer worship. \nThe best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang (who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the Buddha (Chapter 7) as well as famous monasteries. \nEach of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they carried back with them. \nXuan Zang, who took the land route back to China (through the north-west, and Central Asia) carried back with him statues of the Buddha made of gold, silver and sandalwood, and over 600 manuscripts loaded on the backs of 20 horses. Over 50 manuscripts were lost when the boat on which he was crossing the Indus capsized. He spent the rest of his life translating the remaining manuscripts from Sanskrit into Chinese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nFrom the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people. The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain. As the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \u201cThey are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others.\u201d \nThe Vaishnava poet-saints of Maharashtra such as Jnaneshwar, Namadeva, Eknath and Tukaram were devotees of lord Vitthala. Devotion around lord Vitthala gave rise to the Varkari sect which lay emphasis on an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur. The cult of Vitthala emerged as a powerful mode of devotion and was very popular amongst the people. \nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant Tukaram: He who identifies with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart He treats A slave As his own son Says Tuka I won\u2019t be tired to repeat again Such a man Is God In person. Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela\u2019s son: You made us low caste, Why don\u2019t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life \u2013 left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this. You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha\u2019s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the diverse approaches and key figures involved in challenging caste discrimination and promoting social equality, as described in the provided text?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text details multiple strategies and individuals engaged in combating caste discrimination and advocating for social equality. \n\n1.  **Early Reformers and Organizations:** Rammohun Roy translated a Buddhist text critical of caste.

In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 10. \nIn the north, and in parts of central India, a general of the Mauryas, named Pushyamitra Shunga, set up a kingdom. The Shungas were followed by another dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 1700 years ago. \nThe Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. \nIn south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms and kings as well. We know about them from their coins and inscriptions, as well as from books.t \nThere were other changes that were taking place, in which ordinary men and women played a major role.

They practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Describe the administrative divisions of the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga and explain how Shah Jahan's urban planning in his capital cities utilized riverfront access."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. **Gond Administrative Divisions:** The first text section states that the administrative system of the Gond kingdoms, including Garha Katanga, was becoming centralised.

In the early ninth century when the Pandyan king Shrimara Shrivallabha invaded Sri Lanka and defeated the king, Sena I (831-851), the Buddhist monk and chronicler Dhammakitti noted: \u201che removed all the valuables ... The statue of the Buddha made entirely of gold in the Jewel Palace ... and the golden images in the various monasteries \u2013 all these he seized.\u201d The blow to the pride of the Sinhalese ruler had to be avenged and the next Sinhalese ruler, Sena II, ordered his general to invade Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. The Buddhist chronicler noted that the expedition made a special effort to find and restore the gold statue of the Buddha. \nSimilarly in the early eleventh century, when the Chola king Rajendra I built a Shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated rulers. An incomplete list included: a Sun-pedestal from the Chalukyas, a Ganesha statue and several statues of Durga; a Nandi statue from the eastern Chalukyas; an image of Bhairava (a form of Shiva) and Bhairavi from the Kalingas of Orissa; and a Kali statue from the Palas of Bengal. \nSultan Mahmud of Ghazni was a contemporary of Rajendra I. During his campaigns in the subcontinent he attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols. Sultan Mahmud was not a very important ruler at that time. But by destroying temples \u2013 especially the one at Somnath \u2013 he tried to win credit as a great hero of Islam. In the political culture of the Middle Ages most rulers displayed their political might and military success by attacking and looting the places of worship of defeated rulers. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas were defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 11). The Shakas in turn were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago).

These indicate that people, perhaps belonging to the same family, were buried in the same place though not at the same time. The bodies of those who died later were brought into the grave through the portholes.

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nThe thousand years of history that we are exploring witnessed major developments in religious traditions. People\u2019s belief in the divine was sometimes deeply personal, but more usually it was collective. Collective belief in a supernatural agency \u2013 religion \u2013 was often closely connected with the social and economic organisation of local communities. As the social worlds of these groups altered so too did their beliefs. \nIt was during this period that important changes occurred in what we call Hinduism today. These included the worship of new deities, the construction of temples by royalty and the growing importance of Brahmanas, the priests, as dominant groups in society. Their knowledge of Sanskrit texts earned the Brahmanas a lot of respect in society. Their dominant position was consolidated by the support of their patrons \u2013 new rulers searching for prestige. \nOne of the major developments of this period was the emergence of the idea of bhakti \u2013 of a loving, personal deity that devotees could reach without the aid of priests or elaborate rituals. You will be learning about this, and other traditions, in Chapter 8. \nThis was also the period when new religions appeared in the subcontinent. Merchants and migrants first brought the teachings of the holy Quran to India in the seventh century. Muslims regard the Quran as their holy book and accept the sovereignty of the one God, Allah, whose love, mercy and bounty embrace all those who believe in Him, without regard to social background. \nMany rulers were patrons of Islam and the ulama \u2013 learned theologians and jurists. And like Hinduism, Islam was interpreted in a variety of ways by its followers. There were the Shia Muslims who believed that the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s son-in-law, Ali, was the legitimate leader of the Muslim community, and the Sunni Muslims who accepted the authority of the early leaders (Khalifas) of the community, and the succeeding Khalifas. There were other important differences between the various schools of law (Hanafi and Shafi\u2019i mainly in India), and in theology and mystic traditions. \nPatron - An influential, wealthy individual who supports another person \u2013 an artiste, a craftsperson, a learned man, or a noble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did rulers interact with religious traditions and structures, both in their construction and destruction, during the period following the Mauryan empire's collapse?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The provided text indicates multiple ways rulers interacted with religious traditions and structures.

These details collectively describe the dual interaction of rulers with religious structures.\n\nAnswer: Rulers actively engaged with religious traditions and structures by constructing temples to demonstrate their devotion, power, and wealth, and by acting as patrons for new religions like Islam and their learned figures. Conversely, they frequently targeted and looted the temples and idols of defeated rival kingdoms during warfare, using these acts to display their political might and military success."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.8", "6.8.9", "8.10.1", "7.5.4", "7.1.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was in no other place. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBy the seventh century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. Existing kings often acknowledged them as their subordinates or samantas. They were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords, be present at their courts and provide them with military support. As samantas gained power and wealth, they declared themselves to be maha-samanta, maha-mandaleshvara (the great lord of a \u201ccircle\u201d or region) and so on. Sometimes they asserted their independence from their overlords. \nOne such instance was that of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. Initially they were subordinate to the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and performed a ritual called hiranya-garbha (literally, the golden womb). When this ritual was performed with the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the \u201crebirth\u201d of the sacrificer as a Kshatriya, even if he was not one by birth. \nIn other cases, men from enterprising families used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the Gurjara- Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and Rajasthan respectively. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about the past depending upon the period of their study and the nature of their investigation. Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later. The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in large library collections. \nArchive - A place where documents and manuscripts are stored. Today all national and state governments have archives where they keep all their old official records and transactions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What significant challenges did historians encounter when utilizing textual records and manuscripts from the period between 700 and 1750, and what were the primary reasons for these difficulties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the third section explicitly details the challenges historians faced with textual records and manuscripts.

During this copying process, scribes 'introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there', which accumulated over centuries, leading to 'manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another'. 3. Historians rarely find the 'original manuscript of the author' and are dependent on later copies, necessitating the comparison of 'different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written'. 4. Additionally, authors sometimes 'revised their chronicles at different times', as exemplified by Ziyauddin Barani, whose earlier version remained unknown for a long time.\n\nAnswer: Historians faced significant challenges with textual records and manuscripts from 700 to 1750 primarily because there was no printing press, requiring scribes to copy texts by hand. This manual copying led to the introduction of small, cumulative changes over time, resulting in substantially different versions of the same text. Furthermore, historians rarely had access to original manuscripts, relying instead on these varied copies, and authors occasionally revised their own chronicles at different times, adding to the complexity of historical interpretation."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.1", "7.8.8", "7.1.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

So, we assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, early Sanskrit texts (mid-first millennium BCE) suggest that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? \nFrom the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south Bihar), which may have led to the growing influence of Sanskrit. During the fourth century the Gupta rulers established political control over north Bengal and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the linguistic and cultural influence from the mid-Ganga valley became stronger. In the seventh century the Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. \nFrom the eighth century, Bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal suba. While Persian was the language of administration, Bengali developed as a regional language. \nIn fact by the fifteenth century the Bengali group of dialects came to be united by a common literary language based on the spoken language of the western part of the region, now known as West Bengal. Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, and European languages, have become part of modern Bengali. \nEarly Bengali literature may be divided into two categories \u2013 one indebted to Sanskrit and the other independent of it. The first includes translations of the Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 8). \nThe second includes Nath literature such as the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy tales, folk tales and ballads. \nThe Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of yogic practices. This particular song, which was often enacted, described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the face of a variety of obstacles. Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood. \nThe texts belonging to the first category are easier to date, as several manuscripts have been found indicating that they were composed between the late fifteenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Those belonging to the second category circulated orally and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly popular in eastern Bengal, where the influence of Brahmanas was relatively weak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nSomewhat before the time of the Mauryan empire, about 2400 years ago, emperors in China began building the Great Wall. \nIt was meant to protect the northern frontier of the empire from pastoral people. Additions to the wall were made over a period of 2000 years because the frontiers of the empire kept shifting. The wall is about 6400 km long, and is made of stone and brick, with a road along the top. Several thousand people worked to build the wall. There are watch towers all along, at distances of about 100-200 m. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nSeals may have been used to stamp bags or packets containing goods that were sent from one place to another. After a bag was closed or tied, a layer of wet clay was applied on the knot, and the seal was pressed on it. The impression of the seal is known as a sealing. If the sealing was intact, one could be sure that the goods had arrived safely. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nSovereign \u2013 The capacity to act independently without outside interference. \n Publicist \u2013 Someone who publicises an idea by circulating information, writing reports, speaking at meetings. \n Repeal \u2013 To undo law; to officially end the validity of something such as a law. \n Revolutionary violence - The use of violence to make a radical change within society. \n Council \u2013 An appointed or elected body of people with an administrative, advisory or representative function. \n \n9 The Making of the National Movement: 1870s--1947 \n\n In the previous chapters we have looked at: \u00a2 The British conquest of territories, and takeover of kingdoms \u00a2 Introduction of new laws and administrative institutions \u00a2 Changes in the lives of peasants and tribals \u00a2 Educational changes in the nineteenth century \u00a2 Debates regarding the condition of women \u00a2 Challenges to the caste system \u00a2 Social and religious reform \u00a2 The revolt of 1857 and its aftermath \u00a2 The decline of crafts and growth of industries On the basis of what you have read about these issues, do you think Indians were discontented with British rule? If so, how were different groups and classes dissatisfied? \nThe Emergence of Nationalism \n\n The above-mentioned developments led the people to ask a crucial question: what is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India \u2013 all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians. \nThis consciousness began to be clearly stated by the political associations formed after 1850, especially those that came into being in the 1870s and 1880s. Most of these were led by English-educated professionals such as lawyers. The more important ones were the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha, the Bombay Presidency Association, and of course the Indian National Congress. \nNote the name, \u201cPoona Sarvajanik Sabha\u201d. The literal meaning of \u201csarvajanik\u201d is \u201cof or for all the people\u201d (sarva = all + janik = of the people). Though many of these associations functioned in specific parts of the country, their goals were stated as the goals of all the people of India, not those of any one region, community or class. They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign \u2013 a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism. In other words, they believed that the Indian people should be empowered to take decisions regarding their affairs. \nThe dissatisfaction with British rule intensified in the 1870s and 1880s. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, disallowing Indians from possessing arms. In the same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted in an effort to silence those who were critical of the government. The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was found \u201cobjectionable\u201d. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But when white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill, Indians were enraged. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. \nThe need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians had been felt since 1880, but the Ilbert Bill controversy deepened this desire. The Indian National Congress was established when 72 delegates from all over the country met at Bombay in December 1885. The early leadership \u2013 Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Badruddin Tyabji, W.C. Bonnerji, Surendranath Banerji, Romesh Chandra Dutt, S. Subramania Iyer, among others \u2013 was largely from Bombay and Calcutta. Naoroji, a businessman and publicist settled in London, and for a time member of the British Parliament, guided the younger nationalists. A retired British official, A.O. Hume, also played a part in bringing Indians from the various regions together. \nA nation in the making It has often been said that the Congress in the first twenty years was \u201cmoderate\u201d in its objectives and methods. During this period it demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration. It wanted the Legislative Councils to be made more representative, given more power, and introduced in provinces where none existed. It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government. For this purpose it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London. \nThe demand for Indianisation of the administration was part of a movement against racisim, since most important jobs at the time were monopolised by white officials, and the British generally assumed that Indians could not be given positions of responsibility. Since British officers were sending a major part of their large salaries home, Indianisation, it was hoped, would also reduce the drain of wealth to England. Other demands included the separation of the judiciary from the executive, the repeal of the Arms Act and the freedom of speech and expression. \nThe early Congress also raised a number of economic issues. It declared that British rule had led to poverty and famines: increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars, and exports of grains to Europe had created food shortages. The Congress demanded reduction of revenue, cut in military expenditure, and more funds for irrigation. It passed many resolutions on the salt tax, treatment of Indian labourers abroad, and the sufferings of forest dwellers \u2013 caused by an interfering forest administration. All this shows that despite being a body of the educated elite, the Congress did not talk only on behalf of professional groups, zamindars or industrialists. \nThe Moderate leaders wanted to develop public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice, and so they would accept the just demands of Indians. What was necessary, therefore, was to express these demands, and make the government aware of the feelings of Indians. \n\u201cFreedom is our birthright\u201d \n By the 1890s many Indians began to raise questions about the political style of the Congress. In Bengal, Maharashtra and Punjab, leaders such as Bepin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai were beginning to explore more radical objectives and methods. They criticised the Moderates for their \u201cpolitics of prayers\u201d, and emphasised the importance of self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must rely on their own strength, not on the \u201cgood\u201d intentions of the government; people must fight for swaraj. T ilak raised the slogan, \u201cFreedom is my birthright and I shall have it!\u201d \nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal. At that time Bengal was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The British argued for dividing Bengal for reasons of administrative convenience. But what did \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d mean? Whose \u201cconvenience\u201d did it represent? Clearly, it was closely tied to the interests of British officials and businessmen. Even so, instead of removing the non-Bengali areas from the province, the government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam. Perhaps the main British motives were to curtail the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people. \nThe partition of Bengal infuriated people all over India. All sections of the Congress \u2013 the Moderates and the Radicals, as they may be called \u2013 opposed it. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed. The struggle that unfolded came to be known as the Swadeshi movement, strongest in Bengal but with echoes elsewhere too \u2013 in deltaic Andhra for instance, it was known as the Vandemataram Movement. \nThe Swadeshi movement sought to oppose British rule and encourage the ideas of self-help, swadeshi enterprise, national education, and use of Indian languages. To fight for swaraj, the radicals advocated mass mobilisation and boycott of British institutions and goods. Some individuals also began to suggest that \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d would be necessary to overthrow British rule. \nThe opening decades of the twentieth century were marked by other developments as well. A group of Muslim landlords and nawabs formed the All India Muslim League at Dacca in 1906. The League supported the partition of Bengal. It desired separate electorates for Muslims, a demand conceded by the government in 1909. Some seats in the councils were now reserved for Muslims who would be elected by Muslim voters. This tempted politicians to gather a following by distributing favours to their own religious groups. \nMeanwhile, the Congress split in 1907. The Moderates were opposed to the use of boycott. They felt that it involved the use of force. After the split the Congress came to be dominated by the Moderates with Tilak\u2019s followers functioning from outside. The two groups reunited in December 1915. Next year the Congress and the Muslim League signed the historic Lucknow Pact and decided to work together for representative government in the country. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the initial objectives and methods of the Indian National Congress, and how did these evolve with the rise of more radical leadership by the 1890s, including key figures and their defining slogans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text in the section 'The Making of the National Movement: 1870s--1947' details the objectives and methods of the Indian National Congress.

He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nMonuments provide an insight into the technologies used for construction. Take something like a roof for example. We can make this by placing wooden beams or a slab of stone across four walls. But the task becomes difficult if we want to make a large room with an elaborate superstructure. This requires more sophisticated skills. \nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms, doors and windows to buildings. Roofs, doors and windows were still made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns, a style of architecture called \u201ctrabeate\u201d or \u201ccorbelled\u201d. Between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style was used in the construction of temples, mosques, tombs and in buildings attached to large stepped-wells (baolis). \nRaniji ki baori or the \u2018Queen\u2019s Stepwell\u2019, located in Bundi in Rajasthan is the largest among the fifty step wells that were built to meet the need for water. Known for its architectural beauty, the baori was constructed in 1699 C.E. by Rani Nathavat Ji, the queen of Raja Anirudh Singh of Bundi. \nThe Kandariya Mahadeva temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed in 999 by the king Dhangadeva of the Chandela dynasty. Fig. 3b is the plan of the temple. An ornamented gateway led to an entrance, and the main hall (mahamandapa) where dances were performed. The image of the chief deity was kept in the main shrine (garbhagriha). This was the place for ritual worship where only the king, his immediate family and priests gathered. The Khajuraho complex contained royal temples where commoners were not allowed entry. The temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures. \nThe Rajarajeshvara temple at Thanjavur had the tallest shikhara amongst temples of its time. Constructing it was not easy because there were no cranes in those days and the 90 tonne stone for the top of the shikhara was too heavy to lift manually. So the architects built an inclined path to the top of the temple, placed the boulder on rollers and rolled it all the way to the top. The path started more than 4 km away so that it would not be too steep. This was dismantled after the temple was constructed. But the residents of the area remembered the experience of the construction of the temple for a long time. Even now a village near the temple is called Charupallam, the \u201cVillage of the Incline\u201d. \nTwo technological and stylistic developments are noticeable from the twelfth century. (1) The weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches. This architectural form was called \u201carcuate\u201d. (2) Limestone cement was increasingly used in construction. This was very high-quality cement, which, when mixed with stone chips hardened into concrete. This made construction of large structures easier and faster. Take a look at the construction site in Figure 6. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nQazi \u2013 A judge \n Mufti \u2013 A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer \n Impeachment \u2013 A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons \n Dharmashastras \u2013 Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour, composed from c. 500 BCE onwards \n Sawar \u2013 Men on horses \n Musket \u2013 A heavy gun used by infantry soldiers \n Matchlock \u2013 An early type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match \nSetting up a New Administration \n\n Warren Hastings (Governor-General from 1773 to 1785) was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal, but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies: Bengal, Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the Governor-General. Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General, introduced several administrative reforms, notably in the sphere of justice. \nFrom 1772 a new system of justice was established. Each district was to have two courts \u2013 a criminal court ( faujdari adalat ) and a civil court (diwani adalat ). Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors. \nA major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra. To bring about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal \u2013 the Sadar Nizamat Adalat \u2013 was also set up at Calcutta. \nThe principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector. As the title suggests, his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges, police officers and darogas. His office \u2013 the Collectorate \u2013 became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. \nThe Company army \n Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry (sawars: trained soldiers on horseback) and infantry, that is, paidal (foot) soldiers. They were given training in archery (teer-andazi) and the use of the sword. The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. \nA change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army (from the Indian word sipahi, meaning soldier). \nAs warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry requirements of the Company\u2019s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma, Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of the Company\u2019s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important. \nIn the early nineteenth century the British began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings? Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nAround the time that the Buddha was preaching and perhaps a little earlier, other thinkers also tried to find answers to difficult questions. Some of them wanted to know about life after death, others wanted to know why sacrifices should be performed. Many of these thinkers felt that there was something permanent in the universe that would last even after death. They described this as the atman or the individual soul and the brahman or the universal soul. They believed that ultimately, both the atman and the brahman were one. \nMany of their ideas were recorded in the Upanishads. These were part of the later Vedic texts. Upanishad literally means \u2018approaching and sitting near\u2019 and the texts contain conversations between teachers and students. Often, ideas were presented through simple dialogues. \nMost Upanishadic thinkers were men, especially brahmins and rajas. Occasionally, there is mention of women thinkers, such as Gargi, who was famous for her learning, and participated in debates held in royal courts. Poor people rarely took part in these discussions. One famous exception was Satyakama Jabala, who was named after his mother, the slave woman Jabali. He had a deep desire to learn about reality, was accepted as a student by a brahmin teacher named Gautama, and became one of the best-known thinkers of the time. Many of the ideas of the Upanishads were later developed by the famous thinker Shankaracharya, about whom you will read in Class VII. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the administrative reforms introduced by Warren Hastings and explain how changes in the Company's military policy, along with specific rumors, contributed to sepoy unrest."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The chain of thought will first identify Warren Hastings' administrative reforms from the 'Setting up a New Administration' section.

From 1772, each district had a criminal court (faujdari adalat) and a civil court (diwani adalat). European district collectors presided over civil courts, interpreting Indian laws with the help of Maulvis and Hindu pandits. Criminal courts were under a qazi and a mufti but supervised by collectors. To achieve uniformity, a digest of Hindu laws was compiled by eleven pandits (translated by N.B. Halhed) in 1775, and a code of Muslim laws was compiled by 1778. The Regulating Act of 1773 established a new Supreme Court and a court of appeal (Sadar Nizamat Adalat) in Calcutta. The Collector's main job was to collect revenue and taxes, and maintain law and order.\n\n2.  **Changes in Company's Military Policy:** The 'Setting up a New Administration' section also details changes in the Company army. Unlike the Mughal army, which relied heavily on cavalry, the East India Company began recruiting peasants and training them as professional soldiers, forming the sepoy army. From the 1820s, as warfare technology changed (e.g., muskets and matchlocks), the Company's cavalry requirements declined, and infantry regiments became more important. The British started developing a uniform military culture, subjecting soldiers to European-style training, drill, and discipline, often ignoring caste and community feelings.\n\n3.  **Contribution to Sepoy Unrest (Rumors/Perceptions):** The 'Through the Eyes of the People' section provides direct accounts of sepoy unrest. \n    *   Vishnubhatt Godse's account mentions sepoys believing the English were determined to wipe out Hindu and Muslim religions, had made a list of eighty-four rules announced in Calcutta, and that kings refused to accept these rules, leading to plans for a 'war of religion.'\n    *   Subedar Sitaram Pande's memoirs state that the seizing of Oudh filled sepoys with distrust. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi incited mutiny by telling 'ten thousand lies' about foreign treachery and the aim to restore the Emperor of Delhi. A crucial rumor was that the cartridges for the new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, which would defile both Mahommedans and Hindus. Interested parties quickly spread the idea that the English aimed to convert them all to Christians through this cartridge.\n\nAnswer: Warren Hastings introduced significant administrative reforms, particularly in the sphere of justice. From 1772, a new system established two courts per district: a civil court (diwani adalat) presided over by European district collectors, who were aided by Maulvis and Hindu pandits, and a criminal court (faujdari adalat) under a qazi and a mufti, but supervised by collectors. To ensure uniformity, a digest of Hindu laws was compiled in 1775 (translated by N.B. Halhed), and a code of Muslim laws by 1778. The Regulating Act of 1773 also established a new Supreme Court and a court of appeal, the Sadar Nizamat Adalat, in Calcutta. The Collector became the central figure, responsible for revenue collection and maintaining law and order.\n\nConcurrently, changes in the Company's military policy contributed to sepoy unrest. The Company transitioned from a cavalry-dominated force to a sepoy army by recruiting and training peasants as professional soldiers. From the 1820s, with new warfare technologies like muskets and matchlocks, infantry regiments gained prominence. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European-style training, drill, and discipline, often disregarding their caste and community feelings.\n\nThese military changes, coupled with specific rumors and perceptions, fueled deep distrust among sepoys. Vishnubhatt Godse's account notes sepoys believed the English intended to eradicate Hindu and Muslim religions through 'eighty-four rules,' leading kings to plan a 'war of religion.' Subedar Sitaram Pande's memoirs highlight that the seizure of Oudh instilled distrust. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and the King of Delhi actively incited mutiny by spreading falsehoods about foreign treachery and the goal of restoring the Emperor of Delhi. Critically, a widespread rumor claimed the new rifle cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs, which would defile both Mahommedans and Hindus. This was leveraged by 'interested parties' who claimed the English's ultimate aim was to convert them to Christianity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.5.2", "6.7.8", "8.2.4", "7.5.2", "6.7.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The best example of this process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To date, the local tribal people make the wooden image of the deity, which suggests that the deity was originally a local god, who was later identified with Vishnu. \nIn the twelfth century, one of the most important rulers of the Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman, decided to erect a temple for Purushottama Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed himself as the \u201cdeputy\u201d of the god. \nAs the temple gained in importance as a centre of pilgrimage, its authority in social and political matters also increased. All those who conquered Orissa, such as the Mughals, the Marathas and the English East India Company, attempted to gain control over the temple. They felt that this would make their rule acceptable to the local people. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHindu The word \u2018Hindu\u2019, like the term \u2018India\u2019 is derived from the river Indus.

There were people who planned the construction of special buildings in the city. These were probably the rulers. It is likely that the rulers sent people to distant lands to get metal, precious stones, and other things that they wanted. They may have kept the most valuable objects, such as ornaments of gold and silver, or beautiful beads, for themselves. And there were scribes, people who knew how to write, who helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. \nBesides, there were men and women, crafts persons, making all kinds of things \u2014 either in their own homes, or in special workshops. People were travelling to distant lands or returning with raw materials and, perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have been found and children must have played with these \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nYou may have noticed that each of these ruling dynasties was based in a specific region. At the same time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj. Because there were three \u201cparties\u201d in this longdrawn conflict, historians often describe it as the \u201ctripartite struggle\u201d. \nAs we will see (pp. 62-66), rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples. So, when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms, they often chose to target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich. You will read more about this in Chapter 5. \nOne of the best known of such rulers is Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. He ruled from 997 to 1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia, Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent. He raided the subcontinent almost every year \u2013 his targets were wealthy temples, including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni. \nSultan Mahmud was also interested in finding out more about the people he conquered, and entrusted a scholar named Al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent. This Arabic work, known as the Kitab ul-Hind, remains an important source for historians. He consulted Sanskrit scholars to prepare this account. \nOther kings who engaged in warfare included the Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They attempted to expand their control to the west and the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh. The best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very next year, in 1192. \nSultan - An Arabic term meaning ruler. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Gonds lived in a vast forested region called Gondwana \u2013 or \u201ccountry inhabited by Gonds\u201d. They practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan had its own raja or rai. About the time that the power of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller Gond chiefs. The Akbar Nama, a history of Akbar\u2019s reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga that had 70,000 villages. \nShifting cultivation Trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt. The crop is sown in the ashes. When this land loses its fertility, another plot of land is cleared and planted in the same way. \nThe administrative system of these kingdoms was becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into garhs. Each garh was controlled by a particular Gond clan. This was further divided into units of 84 villages called chaurasi. The chaurasi was subdivided into barhots which were made up of 12 villages each. \nThe emergence of large states changed the nature of Gond society. Their basically equal society gradually got divided into unequal social classes. Brahmanas received land grants from the Gond rajas and became more influential. The Gond chiefs now wished to be recognised as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the Gond raja of Garha Katanga, assumed the title of Sangram Shah. His son, Dalpat, married princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. \nDalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very capable, and started ruling on behalf of her five-year-old son, Bir Narain. Under her, the kingdom became even more extensive. In 1565, the Mughal forces under Asaf Khan attacked Garha Katanga. A strong resistance was put up by Rani Durgawati. She was defeated and preferred to die rather than surrender. Her son, too, died fighting soon after. \nGarha Katanga was a rich state. It earned much wealth by trapping and exporting wild elephants to other kingdoms. When the Mughals defeated the Gonds, they captured a huge booty of precious coins and elephants. They annexed part of the kingdom and granted the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, the Gond kingdoms survived for some time. However, they became much weaker and later struggled unsuccessfully against the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. \nThe Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra valley from present-day Myanmar in the thirteenth century. They created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans (landlords). During the sixteenth century, they annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas (1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and subjugated many other tribes. The Ahoms built a large state, and for this they used firearms as early as the 1530s. By the 1660s they could even make highquality gunpowder and cannons. \nHowever, the Ahoms faced many invasions from the south-west. In 1662, the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But direct Mughal control over the region could not last long. \nThe Ahom state depended upon forced labour. Those forced to work for the state were called paiks. A census of the population was taken. Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation. People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the first half of the seventeenth century the administration became quite centralised. \nAlmost all adult males served in the army during war. At other times, they were engaged in building dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation. \nAhom society was divided into clans or khels. There were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A khel often controlled several villages. The peasant was given land by his village community. Even the king could not take it away without the community\u2019s consent. \nOriginally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods. During the first half of the seventeenth century, however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714-1744), Hinduism became the predominant religion. But the Ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after adopting Hinduism. \nAhom society was very sophisticated. Poets and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were translated into the local language. Historical works, known as buranjis, were also written \u2013 first in the Ahom language and then in Assamese. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nOstriches were found in India during the Palaeolithic period.

Later, some Zoroastrians migrated from Iran and settled down in the coastal towns of Gujarat and Maharashtra. They were the ancestors of today\u2019s Parsis. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThere are several ways of describing people \u2014 in terms of the work they do, the language they speak, the place they belong to, their family, their communities and cultural practices. Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. \nThere are two groups who are described in terms of their work \u2014 the priests, sometimes called brahmins, who performed various rituals, and the rajas. \nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be learning about later. They did not have capital cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. Generally, sons did not automatically succeed fathers as rajas. \nTwo words were used to describe the people or the community as a whole. One was the word jana, which we still use in Hindi and other languages. The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 6. \nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name. So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and so on. \nSometimes, the people who composed the hymns described themselves as Aryas and called their opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were women and men who were often captured in war. They were treated as the property of their owners, who could make them do whatever work they wanted. \nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of these. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nKabir, who probably lived in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, was one of the most influential saints. He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nIn the nineteenth century, the region that constitutes most of present-day Rajasthan, was called Rajputana by the British. While this may suggest that this was an area that was inhabited only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. There were (and are) several groups who identify themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern and central India. And of course, there are several peoples other than Rajputs who live in Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often recognised as contributing to the distinctive culture of Rajasthan. \nThese cultural traditions were closely linked with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. From about the eighth century, most of the present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) was one such ruler. These rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes were recorded in poems and songs, which were recited by specially trained minstrels. These preserved the memories of heroes and were expected to inspire others to follow their example. Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories \u2013 which often depicted dramatic situations, and a range of strong emotions \u2013 loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger, etc. \nDid women find a place within these stories? Sometimes, they figure as the \u201ccause\u201d for conflicts, as men fought with one another to either \u201cwin\u201d or \u201cprotect\u201d women. Women are also depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death \u2013 there are stories about the practice of sati or the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay for it with their lives. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the fundamental teachings of Zoroaster, and how did Kabir's approach to religious practice contrast with the external rituals and traditions of his time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: To answer this question, I will first extract Zoroaster's core teachings from the first text section. The text states: 'The basic teachings of Zoroaster are contained in the maxim \u201cGood thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.\u201d' It also mentions a verse from the Zend Avesta about 'strength and the rule of truth and good thinking, by means of which one shall create peace and tranquillity.'\n\nNext, I will identify Kabir's approach to religious practice and his stance on external rituals from the third text section. This section explicitly states: 'Kabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions.

These were Awadh, Bengal and Hyderabad. All three states were founded by members of the high Mughal nobility who had been governors of large provinces \u2013 Sa\u2018adat Khan (Awadh), Murshid Quli Khan (Bengal) and Asaf Jah (Hyderabad). All three had occupied high mansabdari positions and enjoyed the trust and confidence of the emperors. Both Asaf Jah and Murshid Quli Khan held a zat rank of 7,000 each, while Sa\u2018adat Khan\u2019s zat was 6,000. \nNizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of Hyderabad state (1724-1748), was one of the most powerful members at the court of the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the governorship of Awadh, and later given charge of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the Deccan provinces, during 1720-22 Asaf Jah had already gained control over its political and financial administration. Taking subsequent advantage of the turmoil in the Deccan and the competition amongst the court nobility, he gathered power in his hands and became the actual ruler of that region. \nAsaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the new opportunities in the south. He appointed mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he ruled quite independently without seeking any direction from Delhi or facing any interference. The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah. \nThe state of Hyderabad was constantly engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to the west and with independent Telugu warrior chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions of the Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah to control the rich textile-producing areas of the Coromandel coast in the east were checked by the British who were becoming increasingly powerful in that region (see Map 2). \nA description of the Nizam of Hyderabad\u2019s personal troopers in 1790: \u2026The Nizam has a swaree (sawari) of 400 elephants, several thousand of horsemen near his person who receive upwards 100 R(upees)s nominal pay (and) are extremely well mounted and richly caparisoned \nBurhan-ul-Mulk Sa\u2018adat Khan was appointed subadar of Awadh in 1722 and founded a state which was one of the most important to emerge out of the break-up of the Mughal Empire. Awadh was a prosperous region, controlling the rich alluvial Ganga plain and the main trade route between north India and Bengal. Burhan-ul-Mulk also held the combined offices of subadari, diwani and faujdari. In other words, he was responsible for managing the political, financial and military affairs of the province of Awadh. \nBurhan-ul-Mulk tried to decrease Mughal influence in the Awadh region by reducing the number of office holders (jagirdars) appointed by the Mughals. He also reduced the size of jagirs, and appointed his own loyal servants to vacant positions. The accounts of jagirdars were checked to prevent cheating and the revenues of all districts were reassessed by officials appointed by the Nawab\u2019s court. He seized a number of Rajput zamindaris and the agriculturally fertile lands of the Afghans of Rohilkhand. \nThe state depended on local bankers and mahajans for loans. It sold the right to collect tax to the highest bidders. These \u201crevenue farmers\u201d (ijaradars) agreed to pay the state a fixed sum of money. Local bankers guaranteed the payment of this contracted amount to the state. In turn, the revenue-farmers were given considerable freedom in the assessment and collection of taxes. These developments allowed new social groups, like moneylenders and bankers, to influence the management of the state\u2019s revenue system, something which had not occurred in the past. \nBengal gradually broke away from Mughal control under Murshid Quli Khan who was appointed as the naib, deputy to the governor of the province. Although never a formal subadar, Murshid Quli Khan very quickly seized all the power that went with that office. Like the rulers of Hyderabad and Awadh he also commanded the revenue administration of the state. In an effort to reduce Mughal influence in Bengal he transferred all Mughal jagirdars to Orissa and ordered a major reassessment of the revenues of Bengal. Revenue was collected in cash with great strictness from all zamindars. As a result, many zamindars had to borrow money from bankers and moneylenders. Those unable to pay were forced to sell their lands to larger zamindars. \nThe formation of a regional state in eighteenthcentury Bengal therefore led to considerable change amongst the zamindars. The close connection between the state and bankers \u2013 noticeable in Hyderabad and Awadh as well \u2013 was evident in Bengal under the rule of Alivardi Khan (r. 1740-1756). During his reign the banking house of Jagat Seth became extremely prosperous. \nIf we take a bird\u2019s eye view, we can detect three common features amongst these states. First, though many of the larger states were established by erstwhile Mughal nobles they were highly suspicious of some of the administrative systems that they had inherited, in particular the jagirdari system. Second, their method of tax collection differed. Rather than relying upon the officers of the state, all three regimes contracted with revenue-farmers for the collection of revenue. The practice of ijaradari, thoroughly disapproved of by the Mughals, spread all over India in the eighteenth century. Their impact on the countryside differed considerably. The third common feature in all these regional states was their emerging relationship with rich bankers and merchants. These people lent money to revenue farmers, received land as security and collected taxes from these lands through their own agents. Throughout India the richest merchants and bankers were gaining a stake in the new political order. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the three principal common characteristics shared by the newly formed states of Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad in the eighteenth century, particularly concerning their administrative systems and financial relationships?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly outlines 'three common features amongst these states' in its concluding section. \n1.

This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter the Company could venture across the oceans, looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price, and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition, so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. \nThe royal charter, however, could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India, and had their base in Goa. In fact, it was Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene. \nThe problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased, and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets therefore led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other\u2019s ships, blockaded routes, and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification. \nThis effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened. \nFarman \u2013 A royal edict, a royal order \nEast India Company begins trade in Bengal \n\n The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1851. This was the base from which the Company\u2019s traders, known at that time as \u201cfactors\u201d, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored, and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1898 it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata, which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free. \nThe Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb\u2019s farman, for instance, had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of the Company, who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay, causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal, Murshid Quli Khan, not protest? \nHow trade led to battles \n\n Through the early eighteenth century the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified. After the death of Aurangzeb, the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy, as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions, demanded large tributes for the Company\u2019s right to trade, denied it any right to mint coins, and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes, writing disrespectful letters, and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials. \nThe Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company, and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages, and rebuild its forts. The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey. \nPuppet \u2013 Literally, a toy that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else. \nThe Battle of Plassey \n When Alivardi Khan died in 1758, Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried, though without success, to help one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion, stop fortification, and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with 30,000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar, captured the Company officials, locked the warehouse, disarmed all Englishmen, and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company\u2019s fort there. \nOn hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta, Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally, in 1757, Robert Clive led the Company\u2019s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar, one of Sirajuddaulah\u2019s commanders, never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah. The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India. \nAfter the defeat at Plassey, Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest, through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges, then territories need not be taken over directly. \nSoon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all, they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects. \nWhat could the Company do? When Mir Jafar protested, the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained, he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar (1784), driven out of Bengal, and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs 500,000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars, and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1785 the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs, Clive declared: \u201cWe must indeed become nawabs ourselves.\u201d \nFinally, in 1785 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey, and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops, and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta. \nCompany officials become \u201cnabobs\u201d \n What did it mean to be nawabs? It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs. \nAfter the Battle of Plassey the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras (now Chennai) from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1787 he left India his Indian fortune was worth \u00a3401,102. Interestingly, when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1784, he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself cross-examined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted, he committed suicide in 1774. \nHowever, not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India, return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called \u201cnabobs\u201d \u2013 an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nBose and the INA \n A radical nationalist, with socialist leanings, Bose did not share Gandhiji\u2019s ideal of ahimsa, though he respected him as the \u201cFather of the Nation\u201d. In January 1941, he secretly left his Calcutta home, went to Singapore, via Germany, and raised the Azad Hind Fauj or the Indian National Army (INA). To free India from British control, in 1944, the INA tried to enter India through Imphal and Kohima but the campaign failed. The INA members were imprisoned and tried. People across the country, from all walks of life, participated in the movement against the INA trials. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhile we can learn about the Gupta rulers from their inscriptions and coins, we can find out about some kings from biographies. Harshavardhana, who ruled nearly 1400 years ago, was one such ruler. His court poet, Banabhatta, wrote his biography, the Harshacharita, in Sanskrit. This gives us the genealogy of Harsha, and ends with his becoming king. Xuan Zang, about whom you read in Chapter 10, also spent a lot of time at Harsha\u2019s court and left a detailed account of what he saw. \nHarsha was not the eldest son of his father, but became king of Thanesar after both his father and elder brother died. His brother-in-law was the ruler of Kanauj (see Map 7) and he was killed by the ruler of Bengal. Harsha took over the kingdom of Kanauj, and then led an army against the ruler of Bengal. \nAlthough he was successful in the east, and conquered both Magadha and Bengal, he was not as successful elsewhere. He tried to cross the Narmada to march into the Deccan, but was stopped by a ruler belonging to the Chalukya dynasty, Pulakeshin II. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nA number of Hindu religious stories that were in circulation earlier were written down around the same time. These include the Puranas. Purana literally mean old. The Puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there are accounts about the creation of the world, and about kings. \nThe Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody, including women and shudras, who were not allowed to study the Vedas. They were probably recited in temples by priests, and people came to listen to them. \nTwo Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. Some of you may be familiar with these stories. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins. \nThis was a war to gain control of the throne of the Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story itself was an old one, but was written down in the form in which we know it today, about 1500 years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in Chapter 10, was also included in the Mahabharata. \nThe Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nUnlike taxes, which were collected on a regular basis, tribute was collected as and when it was possible from people who gave a variety of things, more or less willingly. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did the East India Company's pursuit of trade lead to its acquisition of the Diwani rights in Bengal, and what were the key consequences of this shift?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The East India Company's initial objective was to make profit through trade, buying goods cheaply and selling them at higher prices, as outlined by its charter from Queen Elizabeth I in 1800. This pursuit of trade led to intense competition with other European powers and, crucially, to conflicts with local rulers, such as the Nawabs of Bengal. The Nawabs resisted the Company's attempts to fortify settlements, expand trade, and avoid paying duties, which they claimed deprived the Bengal government of revenue and undermined their authority. This escalating conflict culminated in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, where the Company, under Robert Clive, secured its first major victory by defeating Sirajuddaulah with the help of Mir Jafar's betrayal. Following this, the Company attempted to control Bengal through puppet nawabs who would grant trade concessions and privileges. However, these puppet nawabs, like Mir Jafar and Mir Qasim, eventually protested the Company's increasing demands for money to finance its wars and other expenses. This difficulty in working with puppet rulers led Robert Clive to declare that the Company must become 'nawabs ourselves.' Consequently, in 1785, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. This acquisition of Diwani rights was a significant shift, as it allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal to finance its trade (purchasing cotton and silk textiles), maintain its troops, and cover the cost of building its fort and offices in Calcutta. This eliminated the previous necessity of importing gold and silver from Britain to buy goods. Another key consequence was that Company officials, driven by visions of living like nawabs, began to amass personal fortunes, with figures like Robert Clive accumulating vast wealth, leading to them being called 'nabobs'.\n\nAnswer: The East India Company's pursuit of profitable trade, initially enabled by a charter from Queen Elizabeth I, led to fierce competition and conflicts with local rulers, particularly the Nawabs of Bengal, who resisted the Company's demands for duty-free trade and fortifications.

When these puppet rulers failed to meet the Company's escalating financial demands, the Mughal emperor ultimately appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal in 1785. The key consequences of this shift were that the Company could now use Bengal's vast revenue resources to finance its trade, maintain troops, and cover administrative costs, thereby stopping the outflow of gold and silver from Britain.

The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThis was also the time when the worship of certain deities, which became a central feature of later Hinduism, gained in importance. These deities included Shiva, Vishnu, and goddesses such as Durga. \nThese deities were worshipped through Bhakti, an idea that became very popular at this time. Bhakti is generally understood as a person\u2019s devotion to his or her chosen deity. Anybody, whether rich or poor, belonging to the so-called \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 castes, man or woman, could follow the path of Bhakti. \nThe idea of Bhakti is present in the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred book of the Hindus, which is included in the Mahabharata (see Chapter 12). In this Krishna the God, asks Arjuna, his devotee and friend, to abandon all dharmas and take refuge in him, as only he can set Arjuna free from every evil. This form of worship gradually spread to different parts of the country. \nThose who followed the system of Bhakti emphasised devotion and individual worship of a god or goddess, rather than the performance of elaborate sacrifices. \nAccording to this system of belief, if a devotee worships the chosen deity with a pure heart, the deity will appear in the form in which he or she may desire. So, the deity could be thought of as a human being, lion, tree or any other form. Once this idea gained acceptance, artists made beautiful images of these deities. \nBecause the deities were special, these images of the deity were often placed within special homes, places that we describe as temples. You will learn more about these temples in Chapter 12. Bhakti inspired some of the best expressions in art \u2014 sculpture, poetry and architecture. \nBhakti Comes from the Sanskrit term bhaj meaning \u2018to divide or share.\u2019 This suggests an intimate, two-way relationship between the deity and the devotee. Bhakti is directed towards Bhagavat, which is often translated as god, but also means one who possesses and shares bhaga, literally good fortune or bliss. The devotee, known as the bhakta or the bhagavata, shares his or her chosen deity\u2019s bhaga. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThere were at least three different kinds of people living in most villages in the southern and northern parts of the subcontinent. In the Tamil region, large landowners were known as vellalar, ordinary ploughmen were known as uzhavar, and landless labourers, including slaves, were known as kadaisiyar and adimai. \nIn the northern part of the country, the village headman was known as the grama bhojaka. Usually, men from the same family held the position for generations. In other words, the post was hereditary. The grama bhojaka was often the largest landowner. Generally, he had slaves and hired workers to cultivate the land. Besides, as he was powerful, the king often used him to collect taxes from the village. He also functioned as a judge, and sometimes as a policeman. \nApart from the gramabhojaka, there were other independent farmers, known as grihapatis, most of whom were smaller landowners. And then there were men and women such as the dasa karmakara, who did not own land, and had to earn a living working on the fields owned by others. \nIn most villages there were also some crafts persons such as the blacksmith, potter, carpenter and weaver. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary reasons for the Muslim League's initial demand for 'Independent States' for Muslims, and how did their performance in the 1946 provincial elections impact their subsequent demand for 'Pakistan'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains several primary factors for the Muslim League's demand for 'Independent States' for Muslims. Firstly, from the late 1930s, the League began to view Muslims as a separate 'nation' from Hindus, potentially influenced by historical tensions between the two communities in the 1920s and 1930s. Secondly, the provincial elections of 1937 convinced the League that Muslims, as a minority, would consistently play a subordinate role in any democratic system and feared they might go unrepresented. Thirdly, the Congress's refusal to form a joint government with the League in the United Provinces in 1937 further alienated them. Regarding the 1946 provincial elections, the text explicitly states that 'the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular,' and following this success, 'It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d.' This indicates that their strong performance in Muslim-reserved constituencies reinforced and solidified their demand for 'Pakistan'.\n\nAnswer: The Muslim League's demand for 'Independent States' stemmed from their view of Muslims as a separate 'nation' from Hindus, a belief possibly influenced by historical tensions. More significantly, the 1937 provincial elections convinced the League that Muslims would be a perpetual minority, fearing unrepresentation in a democratic structure, and they were further alienated by the Congress's rejection of a joint government in the United Provinces.

How well has the country done in this time? And to what extent has it fulfilled the ideals set out in its Constitution? \nThat India is still united, and that it is still democratic, are achievements that we might justly be proud of. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country, that it would break up into many parts, with each region or linguistic group seeking to form a nation of its own. Others believed that it would come under military rule. However, as many as thirteen general elections have been held since Independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections. There is a free press, as well as an independent judiciary.Finally, the fact that people speak different languages or practise different faiths has not come in the way of national unity. \nOn the other hand, deep divisions persist. Despite constitutional guarantees, the Untouchables or, as they are now referred to, the Dalits, face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks and otherpublic places. And despite the secular ideals enshrined in the Constitution, there have been clashes between different religious groups in many states. Above all, as many observers have noted, the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development. They live in large houses and dine in expensive restaurants, send their children to expensive private schools and take expensive foreign holidays. At the same time many others continue to live below the poverty line. Housed in urban slums, or living in remote villages on lands that yield little, they cannot afford to send their children to school. \nThe Constitution recognises equality before the law, but in real life some Indians are more equal than others. Judged by the standards it set itself at Independence, the Republic of India has not been a great success. But it has not been a failure either. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe rajas who performed these big sacrifices were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas rather than janas. The word janapada literally means the land where the jana set its foot, and settled down. Some important janapadas are shown on Map 4 (page 57). \nArchaeologists have excavated a number of settlements in these janapadas, such as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found that people lived in huts, and kept cattle as well as other animals. They also grew a variety of crops \u2014 rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard. \nThey made earthen pots. Some of these were grey in colour, others were red. One special type of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and geometric patterns. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided texts, what archaeological evidence from ancient graves suggests social status differences, and how do these findings relate to the social divisions described in modern India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The first text describes archaeological findings at Brahmagiri where one skeleton was buried with a significant collection of valuable items (33 gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and one conch shell), in contrast to 'Other skeletons [that] have only a few pots.'\n2. The text explicitly states that 'These finds suggest that there was some difference in status amongst the people who were buried. Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, others followers.' This provides the archaeological evidence for ancient social status differences.\n3. The second text, 'The Nation, Sixty Years On,' discusses modern India, noting that 'deep divisions persist' and 'the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years.' It highlights that 'some parts of India and some groups of Indians have benefited a great deal from economic development' while 'many others continue to live below the poverty line,' indicating ongoing social and economic inequality.\n4. Therefore, the archaeological evidence of varying grave goods points to early forms of social stratification based on wealth and status, which relates to the persistent social divisions and the growing gap between the rich and the poor observed in modern India, where economic development has benefited some groups significantly more than others.\n\nAnswer: Archaeological evidence from ancient graves, such as the varying grave goods found at Brahmagiri (e.g., one skeleton with 33 gold beads and copper bangles versus others with only a few pots), suggests differences in social status among the buried, indicating some were rich or chiefs while others were poor or followers. This relates to modern India where, despite constitutional ideals, deep divisions persist, and the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown, with some benefiting greatly from economic development while many others live below the poverty line, illustrating a continuation of social and economic inequality across different eras."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.5.7", "8.10.6", "6.6.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

There were heated debates about the dates on which rulers were crowned or battles were fought. In the common-sense notion, history was synonymous with dates. You may have heard people say, \u201cI find history boring because it is all about memorising dates.\u201d Is such a conception true? \nHistory is certainly about changes that occur over time. It is about finding out how things were in the past and how things have changed. As soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time, we talk of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d. \nLiving in the world we do not always ask historical questions about what we see around us. We take things for granted, as if what we see has always been in the world we inhabit. But most of us have our moments of wonder, when we are curious, and we ask questions that actually are historical. Watching someone sip a cup of tea at a roadside tea stall you may wonder \u2013 when did people begin to drink tea or coffee? Looking out of the window of a train you may ask yourself \u2013 when were railways built and how did people travel long distances before the age of railways? Reading the newspaper in the morning you may be curious to know how people got to hear about things before newspapers began to be printed. \nAll such historical questions refer us back to notions of time. But time does not have to be always precisely dated in terms of a particular year or a month. Sometimes it is actually incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time. People in India did not begin drinking tea one fine day; they developed a taste for it over time. There can be no one clear date for a process such as this. Similarly, we cannot fix one single date on which British rule was established, or the national movement started, or changes took place within the economy and society. All these things happened over a stretch of time. We can only refer to a span of time, an approximate period over which particular changes became visible. \nWhy, then, do we continue to associate history with a string of dates? This association has a reason. There was a time when history was an account of battles and big events. It was about rulers and their policies. Historians wrote about the year a king was crowned, the year he married, the year he had a child, the year he fought a particular war, the year he died, and the year the next ruler succeeded to the throne. For events such as these, specific dates can be determined, and in histories such as these, debates about dates continue to be important. \nAs you have seen in the history textbooks of the past two years, historians now write about a host of other issues, and other questions. They look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed. \nWhich dates? By what criteria do we choose a set of dates as important? The dates we select, the dates around which we compose our story of the past, are not important on their own. They become vital because we focus on a particular set of events as important. If our focus of study changes, if we begin to look at new issues, a newset of dates will appear significant. \nConsider an example. In the histories written by British historians in India, the rule of each Governor-General was important. These histories began with the rule of the first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and ended with the last Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten. In separate chapters we read about the deeds of others \u2013 Hastings, Wellesley, Bentinck, Dalhousie, Canning, Lawrence, Lytton, Ripon, Curzon, Harding, Irwin. It was a seemingly never-ending succession of Governor-Generals and Viceroys. All the dates in these history books were linked to these personalities \u2013 to their activities, policies, achievements. It was as if there was nothing outside their lives that was important for us to know. The chronology of their lives marked the different chapters of the history of British India. \nCan we not write about the history of this period in a different way? How do we focus on the activities of different groups and classes in Indian society within the format of this history of Governor-Generals? \nWhen we write history, or a story, we divide it into chapters. Why do we do this? It is to give each chapter some coherence. It is to tell a story in a way that makes some sense and can be followed. In the process we focus only on those events that help us to give shape to the story we are telling. In the histories that revolve around the life of British Governor-Generals, the activities of Indians simply do not fit, they have no space. What, then, do we do? Clearly, we need another format for our history. This would mean that the old dates will no longer have the significance they earlier had. A new set of dates will become more important for us to know. \nHow do we periodise? In 1817, James Mill, a Scottish economist and political philosopher, published a massive three-volume work, A History of British India. In this he divided Indian history into three periods \u2013 Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation came to be widely accepted. Can you think of any problem with this way of looking at Indian history? \nWhy do we try and divide history into different periods? We do so in an attempt to capture the characteristics of a time, its central features as they appear to us. So the terms through which we periodise \u2013 that is, demarcate the difference between periods \u2013 become important. They reflect our ideas about the past. They show how we see the significance of the change from one period to the next. \nMill thought that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, Hindu and Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. British rule, Mill felt, could civilise India. To do this it was necessary to introduce European manners, arts, institutions and laws in India. Mill, in fact, suggested that the British should conquer all the territories in India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without British help. \nIn this idea of history, British rule represented all the forces of progress and civilisation. The period before British rule was one of darkness. Can such a conception be accepted today? \nIn any case, can we refer to any period of history as \u201cHindu\u201d or \u201cMuslim\u201d? Did not a variety of faiths exist simultaneously in these periods? Why should we characterise an age only through the religion of the rulers of the time? To do so is to suggest that the lives and practices of the others do not really matter. We should also remember that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith. \nMoving away from British classification, historians have usually divided Indian history into \u2018ancient\u2019, \u2018medieval\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019. This division too has its problems. It is a periodisation that is borrowed from the West where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity \u2013 science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist. Can we uncritically accept this characterisation of the modern period to describe the period of our study? As you will see in this book, under British rule people did not have equality, freedom or liberty. Nor was the period one of economic growth and progress. Many historians therefore refer to this period as \u2018colonial\u2019. \nWhat is colonial? In this book you will read about the way the British came to conquer the country and establish their rule, subjugating local nawabs and rajas. You will see how they established control over the economy and society, collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought the goods they wanted at low prices, produced crops they needed for export, and you will understand the changes that came about as a consequence. You will also come to know about the changes British rule brought about in values and tastes, customs and practices. When the subjugation of one country by another leads to these kinds of political, economic, social and cultural changes, we refer to the process as colonisation. You will, however, find that all classes and groups did not experience these changes in the same way. That is why the book is called Our Pasts in the plural. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nFind Hunsgi on Map 2 (page14). A number of early Palaeolithic sites were found here.

This description focuses on the daily lives, production, and resource utilization of early people. \n2.  **Analyze the 'How, When and Where' Text regarding modern history:** The second text explains that while history was once 'synonymous with dates' and focused on specific events like coronations or battles, modern historians now 'look at how people earned their livelihood, what they produced and ate, how cities developed and markets came up, how kingdoms were formed and new ideas spread, and how cultures and society changed.' It also highlights that it's often 'incorrect to fix precise dates to processes that happen over a period of time' and that focusing on 'a span of time, an approximate period' is more appropriate.\n3.  **Synthesize the connection:** The Hunsgi description exemplifies this modern historical approach because it provides insights into the 'how' and 'what' of early human life \u2013 their activities, production methods, and settlements \u2013 during the 'early Palaeolithic' period, rather than providing specific, precise dates. This aligns with the contemporary historical focus on understanding the broader social and economic aspects of past societies and changes over a span of time, moving beyond a mere 'string of dates'.\n\nAnswer: The description of Hunsgi reflects the modern historical approach by focusing on the activities and livelihoods of early people, such as the discovery of numerous tools indicating 'habitation-cum factory sites' and 'tool making' from 'locally available limestone.'

Here, the word ashrama does not mean a place where people live and meditate. It is used instead for a stage of life. Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha and samnyasa. \nBrahmin, kshatriya and vaishya men were expected to lead simple lives and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya). Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha). Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha). Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins. \nThe system of ashramas allowed men to spend some part of their lives in meditation. Generally, women were not allowed to study the Vedas, and they had to follow the ashramas chosen by their husbands. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe town of Masulipatnam or Machlipatnam (literally, fish port town) lay on the delta of the Krishna river. In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles.

Intense activity and fierce competition among various trading groups also contributed to its growth. Its subsequent decline was caused by the Mughal annexation of Golconda, prompting European Companies, particularly the English East India Company, to relocate their operations to new centers like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras that offered integrated political, administrative, and commercial roles, leading Masulipatnam to lose its merchants and prosperity."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.6.10", "6.7.9"], "num_distractors": 0}}

How did men become rulers in the past? Some of the rajas we read about in Chapter 5 were probably chosen by the jana, the people. But, around 3000 years ago, we find some changes taking place in the ways in which rajas were chosen. Some men now became recognised as rajas by performing very big sacrifices. \nThe ashvamedha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely and it was guarded by the raja\u2019s men. If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them. These rajas were then invited to the sacrifice, which was performed by specially trained priests, who were rewarded with gifts. The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him. \nThe raja was a central figure in these rituals. He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in the battle field and witnessed his exploits, chanted tales of his glory. His relatives, especially his wives and sons, had to perform a variety of minor rituals. The other rajas were simply spectators who had to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice. Priests performed the rituals including the sprinkling of sacred water on the king. The ordinary people, the vish or vaishya, also brought gifts. However, some people, such as those who were regarded as shudras by the priests, were excluded from many rituals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nYou may have noticed that each of these ruling dynasties was based in a specific region. At the same time, they tried to control other areas. One particularly prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for control over Kanauj. Because there were three \u201cparties\u201d in this longdrawn conflict, historians often describe it as the \u201ctripartite struggle\u201d. \nAs we will see (pp. 62-66), rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples. So, when they attacked one another\u2019s kingdoms, they often chose to target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich. You will read more about this in Chapter 5. \nOne of the best known of such rulers is Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. He ruled from 997 to 1030, and extended control over parts of Central Asia, Iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent. He raided the subcontinent almost every year \u2013 his targets were wealthy temples, including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid capital city at Ghazni. \nSultan Mahmud was also interested in finding out more about the people he conquered, and entrusted a scholar named Al-Biruni to write an account of the subcontinent. This Arabic work, known as the Kitab ul-Hind, remains an important source for historians. He consulted Sanskrit scholars to prepare this account. \nOther kings who engaged in warfare included the Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They attempted to expand their control to the west and the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar Pradesh. The best-known Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III (1168-1192), who defeated an Afghan ruler named Sultan Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very next year, in 1192. \nSultan - An Arabic term meaning ruler. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the various ways rulers in ancient and medieval times established or demonstrated their power and authority?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for different ways rulers established or demonstrated their power based on both provided text sections. \n\nFrom the first text section, rulers demonstrated power by: \n1.  Engaging in conflict for control over prized areas, such as the city of Kanauj, leading to prolonged struggles like the 'tripartite struggle' involving the Gurjara-Pratihara, Rashtrakuta, and Pala dynasties. \n2.  Building large temples, which served as demonstrations of their power and resources. \n3.  Attacking and targeting temples in rival kingdoms, especially wealthy ones, during warfare. \n4.  Extending control over vast regions, as exemplified by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, who ruled over parts of Central Asia, Iran, and the north-western subcontinent. \n5.  Raiding wealthy areas, particularly temples (like Somnath), and using the carried-away wealth to create splendid capital cities (Sultan Mahmud at Ghazni). \n6.  Commissioning scholars to write accounts of the people and lands they conquered, such as Sultan Mahmud entrusting Al-Biruni to write the Kitab ul-Hind. \n7.  Engaging in warfare to expand control and defeat other rulers, as shown by the Chahamanas and Prithviraja III's conflict with Sultan Muhammad Ghori.\n\nFrom the second text section, rulers became recognized or demonstrated power by: \n1.  Performing 'very big sacrifices,' such as the ashvamedha or horse sacrifice. \n2.  Having their strength acknowledged by other rajas, indicated if they allowed the sacrificial horse to pass through their kingdoms without stopping it. \n3.  Organizing sacrifices, which led to them being recognized as 'very powerful' and receiving gifts from attending rajas and ordinary people (vish or vaishya). \n4.  Occupying a central, special seat (throne or tiger skin) during rituals. \n5.  Having their charioteer chant tales of their glory during rituals. \n\nCombining these points from both texts provides a comprehensive answer.\n\nAnswer: Rulers established or demonstrated their power and authority in several ways: by fighting for control over prized regions like Kanauj, building large temples, attacking wealthy temples of rival kingdoms during warfare, extending control over vast territories, using acquired wealth to construct splendid capital cities, commissioning scholars to document their conquered lands, and engaging in direct military conflict. In earlier times, power was also established through performing grand sacrifices such as the ashvamedha, where allowing the sacrificial horse to pass signified acceptance of the performing raja's strength, leading to the raja being recognized as powerful and receiving gifts."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.2.4", "6.6.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

Different animals too, prefer different environments \u2014 for instance, sheep and goat can survive more easily than cattle in dry, hilly environments.

This site is located in a fertile plain, near the Bolan Pass, which is one of the most important routes into Iran. Mehrgarh was probably one of the places where women and men learnt to grow barley and wheat, and rear sheep and goats for the first time in this area. It is one of the earliest villages that we know about. \nArchaeologists who excavated the site found evidence of many kinds of animal bones from the earliest levels. These included bones of wild animals such as the deer and pig. In later levels, they found more bones of sheep and goat, and in still later levels, cattle bones are most common, suggesting that this was the animal that was generally kept by the people. \nOther finds at Mehrgarh include remains of square or rectangular houses. Each house had four or more compartments, some of which may have been used for storage. \nWhen people die, their relatives and friends generally pay respect to them. People look after them, perhaps in the belief that there is some form of life after death. Burial is one such arrangement. Several burial sites have been found at Mehrgarh. In one instance, the dead person was buried with goats, which were probably meant to serve as food in the next world. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nMutiny \u2013 When soldiers as a group disobey their officers in the army. Firangis \u2013 Foreigners The term reflects an attitude of contempt. \nA Mutiny Becomes a Popular Rebellion \n\n Though struggles between rulers and the ruled are not unusual, sometimes such struggles become quite widespread as a popular resistance so that the power of the state breaks down. A very large number of people begin to believe that they have a common enemy and rise up against the enemy at the same time. For such a situation to develop people have to organise, communicate, take initiative and display the confidence to turn the situation around. \nSuch a situation developed in the northern parts of India in 1857. After a hundred years of conquest and administration, the English East India Company faced a massive rebellion that started in May 1857 and threatened the Company\u2019s very presence in India. Sepoys mutinied in several places beginning from Meerut and a large number of people from different sections of society rose up in rebellion. Some regard it as the biggest armed resistance to colonialism in the nineteenth century anywhere in the world. \nFrom Meerut to Delhi \n On 29 March 1857, a young soldier, Mangal Pandey, was hanged to death for attacking his officers in Barrackpore. Some days later, some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges, which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs. Eighty-five sepoys were dismissed from service and sentenced to ten years in jail for disobeying their officers. This happened on 9 May 1857. \nThe response of the other Indian soldiers in Meerut was quite extraordinary. On 10 May, the soldiers marched to the jail in Meerut and released the imprisoned sepoys. They attacked and killed British officers. They captured guns and ammunition and set fire to the buildings and properties of the British and declared war on the firangis. The soldiers were determined to bring an end to their rule in the country. But who would rule the land instead? The soldiers had an answer to this question \u2013 the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. \nThe sepoys of Meerut rode all night of 10 May to reach Delhi in the early hours next morning. As news of their arrival spread, the regiments stationed in Delhi also rose up in rebellion. Again british officers were killed, arms and ammunition seized, buildings set on fire. Triumphant soldiers gathered around the walls of the Red Fort where the Badshah lived, demanding to meet him. The emperor was not quite willing to challenge the mighty British power but the soldiers persisted. They forced their way into the palace and proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. \nThe ageing emperor had to accept this demand. He wrote letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight the British. This single step taken by Bahadur Shah had great implications. \nThe Mughal dynasty had ruled over a very large part of the country. Most smaller rulers and chieftains controlled dif ferent territories on behalf of the Mughal ruler. Threatened by the expansion of British rule, many of them felt that if the Mughal emperor could rule again, they too would be able to rule their own territories once more, under Mughal authority. \nThe British had not expected this to happen. They thought the disturbance caused by the issue of the cartridges would die down. But Bahadur Shah Zafar\u2019s decision to bless the rebellion changed the entire situation dramatically. Often when people see an alternative possibility they feel inspired and enthused. It gives them the courage, hope and confidence to act. \nThe rebellion spreads \n After the British were routed from Delhi, there was no uprising for almost a week. It took that much time for news to travel. Then, a spurt of mutinies began. \nRegiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join other troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow. After them, the people of the towns and villages also rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to establish their authority and fight the British. Nana Saheb, the adopted son of the late Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered armed forces and expelled the British garrison from the city. He proclaimed himself Peshwa. He declared that he was a governor under Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. In Lucknow, Birjis Qadr, the son of the deposed Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, was proclaimed the new Nawab. He too acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahadur Shah Zafar. His mother Begum Hazrat Mahal took an active part in organising the uprising against the British. In Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai joined the rebel sepoys and fought the British along with Tantia Tope, the general of Nana Saheb. In the Mandla region of Madhya Pradesh, Rani Avantibai Lodhi of Ramgarh raised and led an army of four thousand against the British who had taken over the administration of her state. \nThe British were greatly outnumbered by the rebel forces. They were defeated in a number of battles. This convinced the people that the rule of the British had collapsed for good and gave them the confidence to take the plunge and join the rebellion. A situation of widespread popular rebellion developed in the region of Awadh in particular. On 6 August 1857, we find a telegram sent by Lieutenant Colonel Tytler to his Commander-in-Chief expressing the fear felt by the British: \u201cOur men are cowed by the numbers opposed to them and the endless fighting. Every village is held against us, the zamindars have risen to oppose us.\u201d \nMany new leaders came up. For example, Ahmadullah Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, prophesied that the rule of the British would come to an end soon. He caught the imagination of the people and raised a huge force of supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British. In Delhi, a large number of ghazis or religious warriors came together to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came to Delhi. He became a key military leader of the rebellion. In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel sepoys and battled with the British for many months. Leaders and fighters from across the land joined the fight. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, what were the immediate causes of the 1857 rebellion in Meerut, how did the sepoys react, and how did Bahadur Shah Zafar's involvement contribute to its wider spread?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that on 9 May 1857, 'some sepoys of the regiment at Meerut refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges, which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs.' This refusal led to 85 sepoys being dismissed and jailed. The reaction of other Indian soldiers in Meerut was to march to the jail on 10 May, release the imprisoned sepoys, attack and kill British officers, capture weapons, set fire to British properties, and declare war on the 'firangis'. They also decided to make the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar their leader. Bahadur Shah Zafar's involvement contributed significantly to the rebellion's spread because, after being forced to accept leadership, 'He wrote letters to all the chiefs and rulers of the country to come forward and organise a confederacy of Indian states to fight the British.'

In response, 85 sepoys were dismissed and jailed. Other soldiers in Meerut reacted by releasing the imprisoned sepoys, attacking British officers, seizing arms, burning British properties, and declaring war, proclaiming Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leader. Bahadur Shah Zafar's involvement contributed to the rebellion's wider spread by inspiring many when he wrote letters to rulers across the country, urging them to form a confederacy against the British, thereby legitimizing and expanding the uprising beyond its initial military points."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.3.9", "6.3.1", "8.5.3"], "num_distractors": 0}}

As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had come into the country from what was now Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems of the refugees and of the princely states had to be addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and expectations of its population. \nIndia\u2019s population in 1947 was large, almost 345 million. It was also divided. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths. The citizens of this vast land spoke many different languages, wore many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds of food and practised different professions. How could they be made to live together in one nation-state? \nTo the problem of unity was added the problem of development. At Independence, the vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either. In the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care. Clearly, the new nation had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing the productivity of agriculture and by promoting new, job-creating industries. \nUnity and development had to go hand in hand. If the divisions between different sections of India were not healed, they could result in violent and costly conflicts \u2013 high castes fighting with low castes, Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time, if the fruits of economic development did not reach the broad masses of the population, it could create fresh divisions \u2013 for example, between the rich and the poor, between cities and the countryside, between regions of India that were prosperous and regions that lagged behind. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nAs in the case of earlier kings, land revenue remained important for these rulers, and the village remained the basic unit of administration. \nThere were some new developments as well. Kings adopted a number of steps to win the support of men who were powerful, either economically, or socially, or because of their political and military strength. For instance: \n\u2022 Some important administrative posts were now hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like his father. \n\u2022 Sometimes, one person held many offices. For instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, meaning a minister of war and peace. \n\u2022 Besides, important men probably had a say in local administration. These included the nagarashreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city, the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the head of the kayasthas or scribes. \nThese policies were reasonably effective, but sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary challenges India faced immediately after gaining independence in August 1947?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explicitly states that 'When India became independent in August 1947, it faced a series of very great challenges.'

It is likely that people made and used tools of stone, wood and bone, of which stone tools have survived best. \nSome of these stone tools were used to cut meat and bone, scrape bark (from trees) and hides (animal skins), chop fruit and roots. Some may have been attached to handles of bone or wood, to make spears and arrows for hunting. Other tools were used to chop wood, which was used as firewood. Wood was also used to make huts and tools. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nHistorians use different types of sources to learn about the past depending upon the period of their study and the nature of their investigation. Last year, for example, you read about rulers of the Gupta dynasty and Harshavardhana. In this book we will read about the following thousand years, from roughly 700 to 1750. \nYou will notice some continuity in the sources used by historians for the study of this period. They still rely on coins, inscriptions, architecture and textual records for information. But there is also considerable discontinuity. The number and variety of textual records increased dramatically during this period. They slowly displaced other types of available information. Through this period paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available. People used it to write holy texts, chronicles of rulers, letters and teachings of saints, petitions and judicial records, and for registers of accounts and taxes. Manuscripts were collected by wealthy people, rulers, monasteries and temples. They were placed in libraries and archives. These manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use. \nThere was no printing press in those days so scribes copied manuscripts by hand. If you have ever copied a friend\u2019s homework you would know that this is not a simple exercise. Sometimes you cannot read your friend\u2019s handwriting and are forced to guess what is written. As a result there are small but significant differences in your copy of your friend\u2019s work. Manuscript copying is somewhat similar. As scribes copied manuscripts, they also introduced small changes \u2013 a word here, a sentence there. These small differences grew over centuries of copying until manuscripts of the same text became substantially different from one another. This is a serious problem because we rarely find the original manuscript of the author today. We are totally dependent upon the copies made by later scribes. As a result historians have to read different manuscript versions of the same text to guess what the author had originally written. \nOn occasion authors revised their chronicles at different times. The fourteenth-century chronicler Ziyauddin Barani wrote his chronicle first in 1356 and another version two years later. The two differ from each other but historians did not know about the existence of the first version until the 1960s. It remained lost in large library collections. \nArchive - A place where documents and manuscripts are stored. Today all national and state governments have archives where they keep all their old official records and transactions. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a number of local assemblies. These included the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin land owners. This assembly functioned through subcommittees, which looked after irrigation, agricultural operations, making roads, local temples, etc. \nThe ur was a village assembly found in areas where the land owners were not brahmins. And the nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of these local assemblies continued to function for centuries. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: During the period from roughly 700 to 1750 CE, what were the primary challenges historians faced when using textual records, and what was the underlying cause of these difficulties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that 'manuscripts and documents provide a lot of detailed information to historians but they are also difficult to use' for the period from roughly 700 to 1750 CE.

Sufis were Muslim mystics. They rejected outward religiosity and emphasised love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings. \nIslam propagated strict monotheism or submission to one God. In the eighth and ninth centuries religious scholars developed different aspects of the Holy Law (Shariat) and theology of Islam. While the religion of Islam gradually became more complex, Sufis provided it with an additional dimension that favoured a more personal devotion to God. The Sufis often rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by Muslim religious scholars. They sought union with God much as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world. Like the saint-poets, the Sufis too composed poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed around them. Among the great Sufis of Central Asia were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis, the Sufis too believed that the heart can be trained to look at the world in a different way. They developed elaborate methods of training using zikr (chanting of a name or sacred formula), contemplation, sama (singing), raqs (dancing), discussion of parables, breath control, etc. under the guidance of a master or pir. Thus emerged the silsilas, a spiritual genealogy of Sufi teachers, each following a slightly different method (tariqa) of instruction and ritual practice. \nIn Kashmir the Rishi order of Sufism flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This order was established by Sheikh Nuruddin Wali also known as Nund Rishi and had a deep impact on the life of the people in Kashmir. A number of shrines dedicated to Rishi saints can be found in many parts of Kashmir. \nA large number of Sufis from Central Asia settled in Hindustan from the eleventh century onwards. This process was strengthened with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (Chapter 3), when several major Sufi centres developed all over the subcontinent. The Chishti silsila was among the most influential orders. It had a long line of teachers like Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Delhi, Baba Farid of Punjab, Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi and Bandanawaz Gisudaraz of Gulbarga. \nThe Sufi masters held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices. Devotees of all descriptions including members of the royalty and nobility, and ordinary people flocked to these khanqahs. They discussed spiritual matters, sought the blessings of the saints in solving their worldly problems, or simply attended the music and dance sessions. \nHospice : House of rest for travellers, especially one kept by a religious order. \nOften people attributed Sufi masters with miraculous powers that could relieve others of their illnesses and troubles. The tomb or dargah of a Sufi saint became a place of pilgrimage to which thousands of people of all faiths thronged. \nJalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from his work: He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on the heights or in the lowlands \u2026 I went to the Kaaba of Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna the philosopher. He was beyond the range of Avicenna \u2026 I looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was in no other place. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nThe Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited his father\u2019s estate.

Which do you think is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture or coparcenary ? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWhile many people lived in the cities, others living in the countryside grew crops and reared animals. These farmers and herders supplied food to crafts persons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We know from remains of plants that the Harappans grew wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed and mustard. \nA new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds. While real ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have not survived, toy models have been found. As this region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form of irrigation may have been used. This means that water was stored and supplied to the fields when the plants were growing. \nThe Harappans reared cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available around settlements. However, in the dry summer months large herds of animals were probably taken to greater distances in search of grass and water. They also collected fruits like ber, caught fish and hunted wild animals like the antelope. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe southern half of the subcontinent is marked by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who controlled the river valleys and the coasts became rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 113), who became powerful in south India around 2300 years ago. \nEach of the three chiefs had two centres of power: one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. \nThe chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, they demanded and received gifts from the people. They also went on military expeditions, and collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest amongst their supporters, including members of their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose compositions are found in the Sangam collection composed poems in praise of chiefs who often rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. \nAround 200 years later a dynasty known as the Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see Map 7, page 113). The most important ruler of the Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. We know about him from an inscription composed on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the south, which was also used as a name for the entire southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, western and southern coasts. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: How did Sufis distinguish their spiritual path from more traditional interpretations of Islam, and what specific methods did they employ for spiritual training under the guidance of a master?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text describes Sufis as Muslim mystics who distinguished their path by rejecting outward religiosity and emphasizing love and devotion to God and compassion towards all fellow human beings.

Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger but lower. This is called the lower town. Very often walls of baked brick were built around each part. The bricks were so well baked that they have lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the walls strong. \nIn some cities, special buildings were constructed on the citadel. For example, in Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built in this area. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made water-tight with a layer of natural tar. There were steps leading down to it from two sides, while there were rooms on all sides. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use. Perhaps important people took a dip in this tank on special occasions. \nOther cities, such as Kalibangan and Lothal had fire altars, where sacrifices may have been performed.

He was brought up in a family of Muslim julahas or weavers settled in or near the city of Benares (Varanasi). We have little reliable information about his life. We get to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses called sakhis and pads said to have been composed by him and sung by wandering bhajan singers. Some of these were later collected and preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib, Panch Vani and Bijak. \nHere is a composition of Kabir: O Allah-Ram present in all living beings Have mercy on your servants, O Lord! Why bump your head on the ground, Why bathe your body in water? You kill and you call yourself \u201chumble\u201d But your vices you conceal. Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps the ekadasi fast While the Qazi observes the Ramzan Tell me why does he set aside the eleven months To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth? Hari dwells in the East, they say And Allah resides in the West, Search for him in your heart, in the heart of your heart; There he dwells, Rahim-Ram. \nKabir\u2019s teachings were based on a complete, indeed vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste system. The language of his poetry was a form of spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is difficult to follow. \nKabir believed in a formless Supreme God and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from among both Hindus and Muslims. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe administrative and military efficiency of the Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial prosperity. International travellers described it as the fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign inform us that the highest-ranking mansabdars were only 445 in number out of a total of 8,000. This small number \u2013 a mere 5.6 per cent of the total number of mansabdars \u2013 received 61.5 per cent of the total estimated revenue of the empire as salaries for themselves and their troopers. \nThe Mughal emperors and their mansabdars spent a great deal of their income on salaries and goods. This expenditure benefited the artisans and peasantry who supplied them with goods and produce. But the scale of revenue collection left very little for investment in the hands of the primary producers \u2013 the peasant and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider investing in additional resources \u2013 tools and supplies \u2013 to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and artisanal groups, the merchants and bankers profited in this economic world. \nThe enormous wealth and resources commanded by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the regions. They constituted new dynasties and held command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. Although they continued to recognise the Mughal emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth century the provinces of the empire had consolidated their independent political identities. We will read more about them in Chapter 10. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nArvind was supposed to be acting as Samudragupta, a famous ruler of a dynasty known as the Guptas. We know about Samudragupta from a long inscription, inscribed on the Ashokan pillar at Allahabad.

This fine pottery, especially bowls and plates, were found from several archaeological sites throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it reached these places? Traders may have carried them from the places where they were made, to sell them at other places. \nSouth India was famous for gold, spices, especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, so much so that it was known as black gold. So, traders carried many of these goods to Rome in ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. There must have been quite a lot of trade as many Roman gold coins have been found in south India. \nTraders explored several sea routes. Some of these followed the coasts. There were others across the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these long journeys. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What distinct types of historical evidence are mentioned across the provided texts for understanding ancient urban planning, the reign of Samudragupta, and the economic distribution within the Mughal Empire?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.

This indicates that archaeological evidence and interpretation are the sources.\n2. For the reign of Samudragupta, I consulted the second text. It states, 'We know about Samudragupta from a long inscription, inscribed on the Ashokan pillar at Allahabad.' It further clarifies this inscription is a 'prashasti' composed as a 'Kavya' by Harishena. Thus, inscriptions and literary compositions (prashastis) are the historical evidence.\n3. To understand the economic distribution within the Mughal Empire, I examined the fourth text. This section provides specific data about mansabdars and revenue distribution, stating it is informed by 'Documents from the twentieth year of Shah Jahan\u2019s reign.' This points to official administrative documents as the source of information.\n\nAnswer: The distinct types of historical evidence mentioned are: archaeological findings for ancient urban planning; inscriptions and literary compositions (prashastis) for the reign of Samudragupta; and official administrative documents for the economic distribution within the Mughal Empire."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.4.2", "6.11.1", "6.10.1", "7.4.10", "7.8.10"], "num_distractors": 0}}

In the seventeenth century it was a centre of intense activity. \nBoth the Dutch and English East India Companies attempted to control Masulipatnam as it became the most important port on the Andhra coast. The fort at Masulipatnam was built by the Dutch. \nThis is a description of Masulipatnam by William Methwold, a Factor of the English East India Company, in 1620: This is the chief port of Golconda, where the Right Worshipfull East India Company have their Agent. It is a small town but populous, unwalled, ill built and worse situated; within all the springs are brackish. It was first a poor fisher town \u2026 afterwards, the convenience of the road (a place where ships can anchor) made it a residence for merchants and so continues since our and the Dutch nation frequented this coast. \nFactor Official in-charge of trading activities of the European Trading Companies. \nThe Qutb Shahi rulers of Golconda imposed royal monopolies on the sale of textiles, spices and other items to prevent the trade passing completely into the hands of the various East India Companies. Fierce competition among various trading groups \u2013 the Golconda nobles, Persian merchants, Telugu Komati Chettis, and European traders \u2013 made the city populous and prosperous. As the Mughals began to extend their power to Golconda their representative, the governor Mir Jumla who was also a merchant, began to play off the Dutch and the English against each other. In 1686-1687 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb annexed Golconda. \nThis caused the European Companies to look for alternatives. It was a part of the new policy of the English East India Company that it was not enough if a port had connections with the production centres of the hinterland. The new Company trade centres, it was felt, should combine political, administrative and commercial roles. As the Company traders moved to Bombay, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) and Madras (present-day Chennai), Masulipatnam lost both its merchants and prosperity and declined in the course of the eighteenth century, being today nothing more than a dilapidated little town. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nA Buddhist text tells us: Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nHistorians do not see time just as a passing of hours, days or years \u2013 as a clock or a calendar. Time also reflects changes in social and economic organisation, in the persistence and transformation of ideas and beliefs. The study of time is made somewhat easier by dividing the past into large segments \u2013 periods \u2013 that possess shared characteristics. \nIn the middle of the nineteenth century British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d. This division was based on the idea that the religion of rulers was the only important historical change, and that there were no other significant developments \u2013 in the economy, society or culture. Such a division also ignored the rich diversity of the subcontinent. \nFew historians follow this periodisation today. Most look to economic and social factors to characterise the major elements of different moments of the past. The histories you read last year included a wide range of early societies \u2013 hunter-gatherers, early farmers, people living in towns and villages, and early empires and kingdoms. The histories you will be studying this year are often described as \u201cmedieval\u201d. You will find out more about the spread of peasant societies, the rise of regional and imperial state formations \u2013 sometimes at the cost of pastoral and forest people \u2013 the development of Hinduism and Islam as major religions and the arrival of European trading companies. \nThese thousand years of Indian history witnessed considerable change. After all, the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries were quite different from the eighth or the eleventh. Therefore, describing the entire period as one historical unit is not without its problems. Moreover, the \u201cmedieval\u201d period is often contrasted with the \u201cmodern\u201d period. \u201cModernity\u201d carries with it a sense of material progress and intellectual advancement. This seems to suggest that the medieval period was lacking in any change whatsoever. But of course we know this was not the case. \nDuring these thousand years the societies of the subcontinent were transformed often and economies in several regions reached a level of prosperity that attracted the interest of European trading companies. As you read this book, look out for signs of change and the historical processes at work. Also, whenever you can, compare what you read in this book with what you read last year. Look out for changes and continuities wherever you can, and look at the world around you to see what else has changed or remained the same. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. The word stupa means a mound. While there are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big and small, these have certain common features. Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the Buddha or his followers, or things they used, as well as precious stones, and coins. \nThis box, known as a relic casket, was covered with earth. Later, a layer of mud brick or baked brick was added on top. And then, the dome like structure was sometimes covered with carved stone slabs. \nOften, a path, known as the pradakshina patha, was laid around the stupa. This was surrounded with railings. Entrance to the path was through gateways. Devotees walked around the stupa, in a clockwise direction, as a mark of devotion. Both railings and gateways were often decorated with sculpture. \nFind Amaravati on Map 7 (page 113). This was a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa were made about 2000 years ago. \nOther buildings were hollowed out of rock to make artificial caves. Some of these were very elaborately decorated with sculptures and painted walls. \nSome of the earliest Hindu temples were also built at this time. Deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Durga were worshipped in these shrines. The most important part of the temple was the room known as the garbhagriha, where the image of the chief deity was placed. It was here that priests performed religious rituals, and devotees offered worship to the deity. \nOften, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas required careful planning. Most temples also had a space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where people could assemble. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, how did British historians divide the history of India, and what were the main criticisms of this periodisation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text states that in the middle of the nineteenth century, British historians divided the history of India into three periods: \u201cHindu\u201d, \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cBritish\u201d.

There are four of them \u2013 the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or \u201cwell-said\u201d. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. \nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis). Priests taught students to recite and memorise each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with great care. Most of the hymns were composed, taught and learnt by men. A few were composed by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. \nThe books we use are written and printed. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) than about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his own hymns was established there for his followers. Irrespective of their former creed, caste or gender, his followers ate together in the common kitchen (langar). The sacred space thus created by Baba Guru Nanak was known as dharmsal. It is now known as Gurdwara. \nBefore his death in 1539, Baba Guru Nanak appointed one of his followers as his successor. His name was Lehna but he came to be known as Guru Angad, signifying that he was a part of Baba Guru Nanak himself. Guru Angad compiled the compositions of Baba Guru Nanak, to which he added his own in a new script known as Gurmukhi. The three successors of Guru Angad also wrote under the name of \u201cNanak\u201d and all of their compositions were compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this compilation were added the writings of other figures like Shaikh Farid, Sant Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1706 this compilation was authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur\u2019s son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. It is now known as Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs. \nBy the beginning of the seventeenth century the town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh community as \u2018a state within the state\u2019. The Mughal emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan in 1606. The Sikh movement began to get politicised in the seventeenth century, a development which culminated in the institution of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, called the Khalsa Panth, became a political entity. \nThe changing historical situation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced the development of the Sikh movement. The ideas of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this development from the very beginning. He emphasised the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used the terms nam, dan and isnan for the essence of his teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are now remembered as nam-japna, kirt-karna and vandchhakna, which also underline the importance of right belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. Thus, Baba Guru Nanak\u2019s idea of equality had social and political implications. This might partly explain the difference between the history of the followers of Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of the other religious figures of the medieval centuries, like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu whose ideas were very similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nWe often take the use of iron for granted today.

Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton textiles. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the sixteenth century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe. Memories of this flourishing trade and the craftsmanship of Indian weavers is preserved in many words still current in English and other languages. It is interesting to trace the origin of such words, and see what they tell us. \nWords tell us histories \n European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely woven textiles as \u201cmuslin\u201d \u2013 a word that acquired wide currency. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe, along with the spices, came to be called \u201ccalico\u201d (derived from Calicut), and subsequently calico became the general name for all cotton textiles. \nThere are many other words which point to the popularity of Indian textiles in Western markets. In Fig. 3 you can see a page of an order book that the English East India Company sent to its representatives in Calcutta in 1730. \n The order that year was for 5,89,000 pieces of cloth. Browsing through the order book you would have seen a list of 98 varieties of cotton and silk cloths. These were known by their common name in the European trade as piece goods \u2013 usually woven cloth pieces that were 20 yards long and 1 yard wide. \nNow look at the names of the different varieties of cloth in the book. Amongst the pieces ordered in bulk were printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Do you know where the English term chintz comes from? It is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. From the 1680s there started a craze for printed Indian cotton textiles in England and Europe mainly for their exquisite floral designs, fine texture and relative cheapness. Rich people of England including the Queen herself wore clothes of Indian fabric. \nSimilarly, the word bandanna now refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word \u201cbandhna\u201d (Hindi for tying), and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying. There were other cloths in the order book that were noted by their place of origin: Kasimbazar, Patna, Calcutta, Orissa, Charpoore. The widespread use of such words shows how popular Indian textiles had become in different parts of the world. \nIndian textiles in European markets \n By the early eighteenth century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles. In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles \u2013 chintz \u2013 in England. Interestingly, this Act was known as the Calico Act. \nAt this time textile industries had just begun to develop in England. Unable to compete with Indian textiles, English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. Indian designs were now imitated and printed in England on white muslin or plain unbleached Indian cloth. \nCompetition with Indian textiles also led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles. The invention of the steam engine by Richard Arkwright in 1786 revolutionised cotton textile weaving. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too. \nHowever, Indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the eighteenth century. European trading companies \u2013 the Dutch, the French and the English \u2013 made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and silk textiles in India by importing silver. But as you know (Chapter 2), when the English East India Company gained political power in Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy Indian goods. Instead, they collected revenues from peasants and zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian textiles. \nWho were the weavers? \n Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next. The tanti weavers of Bengal, the julahas or momin weavers of north India, sale and kaikollar and devangs of south India are some of the communities famous for weaving. \nThe first stage of production was spinning \u2013 a work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli. When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver. In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, known as rangrez. For printed cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers known as chhipigars. Handloom weaving and the occupations associated with it provided livelihood for millions of Indians. \nThe decline of Indian textiles The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producers in India in several ways. First: Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets. Second: exporting textiles to England also became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain. \nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century, Englishmade cotton textiles successfully ousted Indian goods from their traditional markets in Africa, America and Europe. Thousands of weavers in India were now thrown out of employment. Bengal weavers were the worst hit. English and European companies stopped buying Indian goods and their agents no longer gave out advances to weavers to secure supplies. Distressed weavers wrote petitions to the government to help them. \nBut worse was still to come. By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the 1880s two-thirds of all the cotton clothes worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners. Thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread were rendered jobless. \nHandloom weaving did not completely die in India. This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. How could machines produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns? These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Nor did the textile manufacturers in Britain produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India. \nYou must have heard of Sholapur in western India and Madura in South India. These towns emerged as important new centres of weaving in the late nineteenth century. Later, during the national movement, Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and handwoven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India, and it was put at the centre of the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931. \nWhat happened to the weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood? Many weavers became agricultural labourers. Some migrated to cities in search of work, and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in Africa and South America. Some of these handloom weavers also found work in the new cotton mills that were established in Bombay (now Mumbai), Ahmedabad, Sholapur, Nagpur and Kanpur. \nCotton mills come up \n The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. It was close to the vast black soil tract of western India where cotton was grown. When the cotton textile mills came up they could get supplies of raw material with ease. \nBy 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay. Many of these were established by Parsi and Gujarati businessmen who had made their money through trade with China. Mills came up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. Thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to the cities to work in the mills. \nIn the first few decades of its existence, the textile factory industry in India faced many problems. It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain. In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected infant industries. The colonial government in India usually refused such protection to local industries. The first major spurt in the development of cotton factory production in India, therefore, was during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined and Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. \nSpinning Jenny \u2013 A machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun. When the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated. \n Aurang \u2013 A Persian term for a warehouse \u2013 a place where goods are collected before being sold; also refers to a workshop. \n Smelting \u2013 The process of obtaining a metal from rock (or soil) by heating it to a very high temperature, or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the text, what were the primary reasons for the decline of Indian textile dominance in world markets and the subsequent rise of the British textile industry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that around 1750, India was the world's largest producer of cotton textiles, highly valued for quality and craftsmanship, and widely traded. From the 1680s, there was a significant 'craze' for Indian printed cotton textiles, such as chintz, in England and Europe due to their exquisite floral designs, fine texture, and relative cheapness. This popularity, however, led to protests from English wool and silk makers by the early eighteenth century, who were worried about the competition from Indian textiles. In response, the British government enacted the Calico Act in 1720, which banned the use of printed cotton textiles (chintz) in England to protect its nascent textile industries and secure a domestic market. Furthermore, the competition with Indian textiles spurred technological innovation in England, leading to inventions like the spinning jenny (1764) and the steam engine (1786), which revolutionized cotton textile weaving, allowing for the production of immense quantities of cloth cheaply. These developments in Britain ultimately led to the decline of Indian textiles by creating competition in European and American markets, imposing very high duties on Indian textiles imported into Britain, and eventually flooding Indian markets with cheaper British cotton cloth by the 1830s, thereby ousting Indian goods.\n\nAnswer: The decline of Indian textile dominance and the rise of the British textile industry were primarily due to the intense popularity of Indian textiles in Europe which prompted protests from English manufacturers, leading to protective legislation like the Calico Act of 1720, and spurred technological innovations such as the spinning jenny and steam engine in Britain. These advancements enabled Britain to produce textiles cheaply, compete globally, impose high duties on Indian imports, and ultimately flood Indian markets with their own goods."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.6.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This period is considerably later than the major climate changes around 12,000 years ago, which led to the development of grasslands and subsequently prompted people to consider herding, rearing animals, and growing plants on their own."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.9.1", "6.2.6", "6.12.2"], "num_distractors": 0}}

How did men become rulers in the past? Some of the rajas we read about in Chapter 5 were probably chosen by the jana, the people. But, around 3000 years ago, we find some changes taking place in the ways in which rajas were chosen. Some men now became recognised as rajas by performing very big sacrifices. \nThe ashvamedha or horse sacrifice was one such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely and it was guarded by the raja\u2019s men. If the horse wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them. These rajas were then invited to the sacrifice, which was performed by specially trained priests, who were rewarded with gifts. The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him. \nThe raja was a central figure in these rituals. He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in the battle field and witnessed his exploits, chanted tales of his glory. His relatives, especially his wives and sons, had to perform a variety of minor rituals. The other rajas were simply spectators who had to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice. Priests performed the rituals including the sprinkling of sacred water on the king. The ordinary people, the vish or vaishya, also brought gifts. However, some people, such as those who were regarded as shudras by the priests, were excluded from many rituals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided text, how did the Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) ritual serve to establish and demonstrate a raja's power and superiority over other rulers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The text explains that the Ashvamedha ritual was a method by which some men became recognized as rajas. It details that if a horse, guarded by the performing raja's men, wandered into other kingdoms and was allowed to pass, it explicitly meant that those other rajas 'accepted that the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was stronger than them.' Conversely, if they stopped the horse, they 'had to fight,' implying a challenge to the performing raja's power. Furthermore, the text states that 'The raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised as being very powerful, and all those who came brought gifts for him,' directly demonstrating his authority and the acknowledgment of his power. Finally, the text notes that 'The other rajas were simply spectators who had to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice,' underscoring their subordinate role compared to the central figure of the organizing raja.\n\nAnswer: The Ashvamedha ritual established a raja's power by requiring other rajas to either fight if they stopped the wandering horse or accept the performing raja's superior strength if they allowed it to pass. The organizing raja was recognized as very powerful, received gifts from all attendees, and other rajas were reduced to mere spectators, thereby demonstrating his dominance."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.6.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

They were also meant to demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron. Take the example of the Rajarajeshvara temple. An inscription mentions that it was built by King Rajarajadeva for the worship of his god, Rajarajeshvaram. Notice how the names of the ruler and the god are very similar. The king took the god\u2019s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god. Through the rituals of worship in the temple one god (Rajarajadeva) honoured another (Rajarajeshvaram). \nThe largest temples were all constructed by kings. The other, lesser deities in the temple were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler. The temple was a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies. As they worshipped their deities together in the royal temples, it seemed as if they brought the just rule of the gods on earth. \nMuslim Sultans and Padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but Persian court chronicles described the Sultan as the \u201cShadow of God\u201d. An inscription in the Quwwat al-Islam mosque explained that God chose Alauddin as a king because he had the qualities of Moses and Solomon, the great lawgivers of the past. The greatest lawgiver and architect was God Himself. He created the world out of chaos and introduced order and symmetry. \nThe Persian terms abad, populated, prosperous, and abadi, flourishing, are both derived from the word ab, meaning water. \nAs each new dynasty came to power, kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers. Constructing places of worship provided rulers with the chance to proclaim their close relationship with God, especially important in an age of rapid political change. Rulers also offered patronage to the learned and pious, and tried to transform their capitals and cities into great cultural centres that brought fame to their rule and their realm. \nIt was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain. At the same time, making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs was highly praised. Sultan Iltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside Dehli-i-Kuhna. It was called the Hauz-i-Sultani or the \u201cKing\u2019s Reservoir\u201d. Can you find it on Map 1 in Chapter 3? Rulers often constructed tanks and reservoirs \u2013 big and small \u2013 for use by ordinary people. Sometimes these tanks and reservoirs were part of a temple, mosque (note the small tank in the Jami Masjid in Fig. 7) or a gurdwara (a place of worship and congregation for Sikhs, Fig. 8). \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have many books that were composed in north India, especially in the areas drained by the Ganga and the Yamuna, during this period. These books are often called later Vedic, because they were composed after the Rigveda about which you learnt in Chapter 5. These include the Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, as well as other books. These were composed by priests, and described how rituals were to be performed. They also contained rules about society \nThere were several different groups in society at this time \u2014 priests and warriors, farmers, herders, traders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk, and forest people. Some priests and warriors were rich, as were some farmers and traders. Others, including many herders, crafts persons, labourers, fishing folk and hunters and gatherers, were poor. \nThe priests divided people into four groups, called varnas. According to them, each varna had a different set of functions. \nThe first varna was that of the brahmin. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. \nIn the second place were the rulers, also known as kshatriyas. They were expected to fight battles and protect people. \nThird were the vish or the vaishyas. They were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. Both the kshatriyas and the vaishyas could perform sacrifices. \nLast were the shudras, who had to serve the other three groups and could not perform any rituals. Often, women were also grouped with the shudras. Both women and shudras were not allowed to study the Vedas. \nThe priests also said that these groups were decided on the basis of birth. For example, if one\u2019s father and mother were brahmins one would automatically become a brahmin, and so on. Later, they classified some people as untouchable. These included some crafts persons, hunters and gatherers, as well as people who helped perform burials and cremations. The priests said that contact with these groups was polluting. \nMany people did not accept the system of varna laid down by the brahmins. Some kings thought they were superior to the priests. Others felt that birth could not be a basis for deciding which varna people belonged to. Besides, some people felt that there should be no differences amongst people based on occupation. Others felt that everybody should be able to perform rituals. And others condemned the practice of untouchability. Also, there were many areas in the subcontinent, such as the north-east, where social and economic differences were not very sharp, and where the influence of the priests was limited. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nRuling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent with such a diversity of people and cultures was an extremely difficult task for any ruler to accomplish in the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors, the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of administration and ideas of governance that outlasted their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, describe the various ways rulers, including kings and sultans, demonstrated their power, legitimacy, and connection to either divine authority or the welfare of their subjects."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1.  The first section indicates that 'rulers, also known as kshatriyas,' were expected to 'fight battles and protect people.' It also mentions 'Some kings thought they were superior to the priests,' showing an assertion of authority against the established social order. \n2.  The second section extensively details how rulers demonstrated their power and legitimacy. \n    *   **Divine connection and power through religious structures:** Kings constructed elaborate temples (e.g., Rajarajeshvara temple) to 'demonstrate the power, wealth and devotion of the patron.' They would take god's names (e.g., King Rajarajadeva for god Rajarajeshvaram) because it was 'auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god.' Temples were considered 'a miniature model of the world ruled by the king and his allies.' Muslim Sultans were described as the 'Shadow of God,' with inscriptions explaining God chose them for qualities like those of great lawgivers. Constructing places of worship allowed rulers to 'proclaim their close relationship with God.'\n    *   **Welfare and just rule:** Rulers also demonstrated their concern for subjects and reinforced their image as just leaders by 'making precious water available by constructing tanks and reservoirs' for ordinary people (e.g., Sultan Iltutmish's Hauz-i-Sultani), which was 'highly praised.' This was linked to the belief that 'the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain.'\n    *   **Cultural patronage:** Rulers further sought to establish fame and legitimacy by transforming their 'capitals and cities into great cultural centres.'\n3.  The final answer synthesizes these points, showing how rulers used military roles, challenges to priestly authority, religious architecture, divine association, public works for welfare, and cultural development to assert and demonstrate their authority.\n\nAnswer: Rulers demonstrated their power and legitimacy in several ways. Early rulers, known as kshatriyas, were expected to fight battles and protect people, and some kings asserted their authority by considering themselves superior to priests. Later, kings and sultans constructed magnificent temples and mosques, which served to demonstrate their power, wealth, and devotion. Kings would take names similar to gods to appear divine, and temples were seen as miniature models of their ruled world. Muslim Sultans were described as the 'Shadow of God,' chosen for their lawgiving qualities. Rulers used these constructions to proclaim a close relationship with God. Additionally, rulers showed concern for their subjects' welfare and reinforced their image as just leaders by constructing tanks and reservoirs, like Sultan Iltutmish's Hauz-i-Sultani, making precious water available, as a just king's rule was believed to bring plenty. They also transformed capitals into great cultural centers to bring fame to their rule."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["6.6.2", "7.5.3", "7.4.1"], "num_distractors": 0}}

This was a time of rapid change in the lives of people. As you saw in Chapter 6, some kings in the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. New cities were developing, and life was changing in the villages as well (see Chapter 10). Many thinkers were trying to understand these changes in society. They also wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. \nThe Buddha belonged to a small gana known as the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he was a young man, he left the comforts of his home in search of knowledge. He wandered for several years, meeting and holding discussions with other thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to realisation, and meditated for days on end under a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he attained enlightenment. After that, he was known as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till he passed away at Kusinara. \nThe Buddha taught that life is full of suffering and unhappiness. This is caused because we have cravings and desires (which often cannot be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we want, we are not satisfied, and want even more (or want other things). The Buddha described this as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant craving could be removed by following moderation in everything. \nHe also taught people to be kind, and to respect the lives of others, including animals. He believed that the results of our actions (called karma), whether good or bad, affect us both in this life and the next. The Buddha taught in the language of the ordinary people, Prakrit, so that everybody could understand his message. \nHe also encouraged people to think for themselves rather than to simply accept what he said.

The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar (Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, who belonged to the \u201cuntouchable\u201d Mahar caste. This regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people. \nThese saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth. In fact they even rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families, earning their livelihood like any other person, while humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain. As the famous Gujarati saint Narsi Mehta said, \u201cThey are Vaishnavas who understand the pain of others.\u201d \nThe Vaishnava poet-saints of Maharashtra such as Jnaneshwar, Namadeva, Eknath and Tukaram were devotees of lord Vitthala. Devotion around lord Vitthala gave rise to the Varkari sect which lay emphasis on an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur. The cult of Vitthala emerged as a powerful mode of devotion and was very popular amongst the people. \nThis is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant Tukaram: He who identifies with the battered and the beaten Mark him as a saint For God is with him He holds Every forsaken man Close to his heart He treats A slave As his own son Says Tuka I won\u2019t be tired to repeat again Such a man Is God In person. Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela\u2019s son: You made us low caste, Why don\u2019t you face that fact, Great Lord? Our whole life \u2013 left-over food to eat. You should be ashamed of this. You have eaten in our home. How can you deny it? Chokha\u2019s (son) Karmamela asks Why did you give me life? \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nWe have seen in Chapter 2 that the climate of the world was changing, and so were plants and animals that people used as food. Men, women and children probably observed several things: the places where edible plants were found, how seeds broke off stalks, fell on the ground, and new plants sprouted from them. Perhaps they began looking after plants \u2014 protecting them from birds and animals so that they could grow and the seeds could ripen. In this way people became farmers. \nWomen, men and children could also attract and then tame animals by leaving food for them near their shelters. The first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that were relatively gentle to come near the camps where they lived. These animals such as sheep, goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and most of them ate grass. Often, people protected these animals from attacks by other wild animals. This is how they became herders. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nLet us see what Samudragupta\u2019s prashasti tells us. The poet praised the king in glowing terms \u2014 as a warrior, as a king who won victories in battle, who was learned and the best of poets. He is also described as equal to the gods. The prashasti was composed in very long sentences. \nHarishena describes four different kinds of rulers, and tells us about Samudragupta\u2019s policies towards them. \n1. The rulers of Aryavarta, the area shaded in green on the map. Here there were nine rulers who were uprooted, and their kingdoms were made a part of Samudragupta\u2019s empire. \n2. The rulers of Dakshinapatha. Here there were twelve rulers, some of whose capitals are marked with red dots on the map. They surrendered to Samudragupta after being defeated and he then allowed them to rule again. \n3. The inner circle of neighbouring states, including Assam, coastal Bengal, Nepal, and a number of gana sanghas (remember Chapter 6) in the northwest, marked in purple on the map. They brought tribute, followed his orders, and attended his court. \n4. The rulers of the outlying areas, marked in blue on the map, perhaps the descendants of the Kushanas and Shakas, and the ruler of Sri Lanka, who submitted to him and offered daughters in marriage. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThrough the Eyes of the People \n\n To get a glimpse of what people were thinking those days about British rule, study Sources 1 and 2. \n The list of eighty-four rules \n Given here are excerpts from the book Majha Pravaas, written by Vishnubhatt Godse, a Brahman from a village in Maharashtra. He and his uncle had set out to attend a yajna being organised in Mathura. Vishnubhatt writes that they met some sepoys on the way who told them that they should not proceed on the journey because a massive upheaval was going to break out in three days. The sepoys said: the English were determined to wipe out the religions of the Hindus and the Muslims \u2026 they had made a list of eighty-four rules and announced these in a gathering of all big kings and princes in Calcutta. They said that the kings refused to accept these rules and warned the English of dire consequences and massive upheaval if these are implemented \u2026 that the kings all returned to their capitals in great anger \u2026 all the big people began making plans. A date was fixed for the war of religion and the secret plan had been circulated from the cantonment in Meerut by letters sent to different cantonments. \n\u201cThere was soon excitement in every regiment\u201d \n Another account we have from those days are the memoirs of Subedar Sitaram Pande. Sitaram Pande was recruited in 1812 as a sepoy in the Bengal Native Army. He served the English for 48 years and retired in 1860. He helped the British to suppress the rebellion though his own son was a rebel and was killed by the British in front of his eyes. On retirement he was persuaded by his Commanding Officer, Norgate, to write his memoirs. He completed the writing in 1861 in Awadhi and Norgate translated it into English and had it published under the title From Sepoy to Subedar. \nHere is an excerpt from what Sitaram Pande wrote: It is my humble opinion that this seizing of Oudh filled the minds of the Sepoys with distrust and led them to plot against the Government. Agents of the Nawab of Oudh and also of the King of Delhi were sent all over India to discover the temper of the army. They worked upon the feelings of sepoys, telling them how treacherously the foreigners had behaved towards their king. They invented ten thousand lies and promises to persuade the soldiers to mutiny and turn against their masters, the English, with the object of restoring the Emperor of Delhi to the throne. They maintained that this was wholly within the army\u2019s powers if the soldiers would only act together and do as they were advised. \nIt chanced that about this time the Sarkar sent parties of men from each regiment to different garrisons for instructions in the use of the new rifle. These men performed the new drill for some time until a report got about by some means or the other, that the cartridges used for these new rifles were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The men from our regiment wrote to others in the regiment telling them about this, and there was soon excitement in every regiment. Some men pointed out that in forty years\u2019 service nothing had ever been done by the Sarkar to insult their religion, but as I have already mentioned the sepoys\u2019 minds had been inflamed by the seizure of Oudh. Interested parties were quick to point out that the great aim of the English was to turn us all into Christians, and they had therefore introduced the cartridge in order to bring this about, since both Mahommedans and Hindus would be defiled by using it. The Colonel sahib was of the opinion that the excitement, which even he could not fail to see, would pass off, as it had done before, and he recommended me to go to my home. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nSurat in Gujarat was the emporium of western trade during the Mughal period along with Cambay (presentday Khambat) and somewhat later, Ahmedabad. Surat was the gateway for trade with West Asia via the Gulf of Ormuz. Surat has also been called the gate to Mecca because many pilgrim ships set sail from here. \nEmporium : A place where goods from diverse production centres are bought and sold. \nThe city was cosmopolitan and people of all castes and creeds lived there. In the seventeenth century the Portuguese, Dutch and English had their factories and warehouses at Surat. According to the English chronicler Ovington who wrote an account of the port in 1689, on average a hundred ships of different countries could be found anchored at the port at any given time. \nThere were also several retail and wholesale shops selling cotton textiles. The textiles of Surat were famous for their gold lace borders (zari) and had a market in West Asia, Africa and Europe. The state built numerous rest-houses to take care of the needs of people from all over the world who came to the city. There were magnificent buildings and innumerable pleasure parks. The Kathiawad seths or mahajans (moneychangers) had huge banking houses at Surat. It is noteworthy that the Surat hundis were honoured in the far-off markets of Cairo in Egypt, Basra in Iraq and Antwerp in Belgium. \nHundi is a note recording a deposit made by a person. The amount deposited can be claimed in another place by presenting the record of the deposit. \nHowever, Surat began to decline towards the end of the seventeenth century. This was because of many factors: the loss of markets and productivity because of the decline of the Mughal Empire, control of the sea routes by the Portuguese and competition from Bombay (present-day Mumbai) where the English East India Company shifted its headquarters in 1668. Today, Surat is a bustling commercial centre. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: According to the provided texts, what were the core tenets of the Maharashtrian bhakti tradition regarding social and religious practices, and what specific religious and political concerns fueled the sepoy unrest against British rule?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for two distinct sets of information: the core tenets of the Maharashtrian bhakti tradition and the reasons for sepoy unrest. \n\nFor the Maharashtrian bhakti tradition, the first text section states that the saint-poets \"rejected all forms of ritualism, outward display of piety and social differences based on birth.\" It also notes their rejection of renunciation, preference for living with families, and emphasis on \"humbly serving fellow human beings in need,\" with the humanist idea that \"bhakti lay in sharing others\u2019 pain.\" This tradition focused on the Vitthala temple in Pandharpur and the \"notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of all people.\"\n\nFor the sepoy unrest, the third text section, 'Through the Eyes of the People,' provides the reasons.

As people were brought together through the growth of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to develop. The idea that all living things pass through countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, the idea that all human beings are not equal even at birth gained ground during this period. The belief that social privileges came from birth in a \u201cnoble\u201d family or a \u201chigh\u201d caste was the subject of many learned texts. \nMany people were uneasy with such ideas and turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas according to which it was possible to overcome social differences and break the cycle of rebirth through personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a Supreme God who could deliver humans from such bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). This idea, advocated in the Bhagavadgita, grew in popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era. \nShiva, Vishnu and Durga as supreme deities came to be worshipped through elaborate rituals. At the same time, gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with Shiva, Vishnu or Durga. In the process, local myths and legends became a part of the Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was possible for devotees to receive the grace of God regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas adopted these beliefs. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nTurn to Map 2 (page14).

Some of the most important ones are in the north-west, in present-day Kashmir, and in east and south India \nTo find out whether these sites were settlements of farmers and herders, scientists study evidence of plants and animal bones. One of the most exciting finds includes remains of burnt grain. (These may have been burnt accidentally or on purpose). Scientists can identify these grains, and so we know that a number of crops were grown in different parts of the subcontinent. They can also identify the bones of different animals. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nThe Company Fights Back \n\n Unnerved by the scale of the upheaval, the Company decided to repress the revolt with all its might. It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife Begum Zinat Mahal were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858. Bahadur Shah Zafar died in the Rangoon jail in November 1862. \nThe recapture of Delhi, however, did not mean that the rebellion died down after that. People continued to resist and battle the British. The British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion. Lucknow was taken in March 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. A similar fate awaited Rani Avantibai, who after initial victory in Kheri, chose to embrace death when surrounded by the British on all sides. Tantia Tope escaped to the jungles of central India and continued to fight a guerrilla war with the support of many tribal and peasant leaders. He was captured, tried and killed in April 1859. \nJust as victories against the British had earlier encouraged rebellion, the defeat of rebel forces encouraged desertions. The British also tried their best to win back the loyalty of the people. They announced rewards for loyal landholders would be allowed to continue to enjoy traditional rights over their lands. Those who had rebelled were told that if they submitted to the British, and if they had not killed any white people, they would remain safe and their rights and claims to land would not be denied. Nevertheless, hundreds of sepoys, rebels, nawabs and rajas were tried and hanged. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='4'>\nTake a look at Maps 1 and 2. Map 1 was made in 1154 CE by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi. The section reproduced here is a detail of the Indian subcontinent from his larger map of the world. Map 2 was made in the 1720s by a French cartographer. The two maps are quite different even though they are of the same area. In al-Idrisi\u2019s map, south India is where we would expect to find north India and Sri Lanka is the island at the top. Place-names are marked in Arabic, and there are some well-known names like Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh (spelt in the map as Qanauj). Map 2 was made nearly 600 years after Map 1, during which time information about the subcontinent had changed considerably. This map seems more familiar to us and the coastal areas in particular are surprisingly detailed. This map was used by European sailors and merchants on their voyages (see Chapter 6). \nEqually important is the fact that the science of cartography differed in the two periods. When historians read documents, maps and texts from the past they have to be sensitive to the different historical backgrounds \u2013 the contexts \u2013 in which information about the past was produced. \nCartographer - A person who makes maps. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What measures did the Company implement to quell the widespread rebellion, and what was the ultimate fate of prominent rebel figures like Bahadur Shah Zafar and Rani Lakshmibai?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks about the Company's actions to suppress a rebellion and the fate of key rebel leaders.

Given below are the important changes that were introduced by the British. \n1. The British Parliament passed a new Act in 1858 and transferred the powers of the East India Company to the British Crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of Indian affairs. A member of the British Cabinet was appointed Secretary of State for India and made responsible for all matters related to the governance of India. He was given a council to advise him, called the India Council. The Governor-General of India was given the title of Viceroy, that is, a personal representative of the Crown. Through these measures the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India. \n2. All ruling chiefs of the country were assured that their territory would never be annexed in future. They were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs, including adopted sons. However, they were made to acknowledge the British Queen as their Sovereign Paramount. Thus the Indian rulers were to hold their kingdoms as subordinates of the British Crown. \n3. It was decided that the proportion of Indian soldiers in the army would be reduced and the number of European soldiers would be increased. It was also decided that instead of recruiting soldiers from Awadh, Bihar, central India and south India, more soldiers would be recruited from among the Gurkhas, Sikhs and Pathans. \n4. The land and property of Muslims was confiscated on a large scale and they were treated with suspicion and hostility. The British believed that they were responsible for the rebellion in a big way. \n 5. The British decided to respect the customary religious and social practices of the people in India. \n 6. Policies were made to protect landlords and zamindars and give them security of rights over their lands. \n Thus a new phase of history began after 1857. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='1'>\nAs construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions: the traditions of one region were adopted by another. In Vijayanagara, for example, the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda (see Chapter 6). In Vrindavan, near Mathura, temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the Mughal palaces in Fatehpur Sikri. \nThe creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross-fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles. Mughal rulers were particularly skilled in adapting regional architectural styles in the construction of their own buildings. In Bengal, for example, the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut. The Mughals liked this \u201cBangla dome\u201d (see Figures 11 and 12 in Chapter 9) so much that they used it in their architecture. The impact of other regions was also evident. In Akbar\u2019s capital at Fatehpur Sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of Gujarat and Malwa. \nEven though the authority of the Mughal rulers waned in the eighteenth century, the architectural styles developed under their patronage were constantly used and adapted by other rulers whenever they tried to establish their own kingdoms. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='2'>\nThe Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study \n Much before the event of 1857, there had taken place another event of a similar nature at a place called Khurda in 1817. Here, it would be instructive for us to study that event and reflect on how resentment against the colonial policies of the British had been building up since the beginning of the 19th century in different parts of the country. \nKhurda, a small kingdom built up in the late 16th century in the south-eastern part of Odisha, was a populous and well-cultivated territory consisting of 105 garhs, 60 large and 1109 small villages at the beginning of the 19th century. Its king, Raja Birakishore Dev had to earlier give up the possession of four parganas, the superintendence of the Jagannath Temple and the administration of fourteen garjats (Princely States) to the Marathas under compulsion. His son and successor, Mukunda Dev II was greatly disturbed with this loss of fortune. Therefore, sensing an opportunity in the Anglo-Maratha conflict, he had entered into negotiations with the British to get back his lost territories and the rights over the Jagannath Temple. But after the occupation of Odisha in 1803, the British showed no inclination to oblige him on either score. Consequently, in alliance with other feudatory chiefs of Odisha and secret support of the Marathas, he tried to assert his rights by force. This led to his deposition and annexation of his territories by the British. As a matter of consolation, he was only given the rights of management of the Jagannath Temple with a grant amounting to a mere one-tenth of the revenue of his former estate and his residence was fixed at Puri. This unfair settlement commenced an era of oppressive foreign rule in Odisha, which paved the way for a serious armed uprising in 1817. \nSoon after taking over Khurda, the British followed a policy of resuming service tenures. It bitterly affected the lives of the ex-militia of the state, the Paiks. The severity of the measure was compounded on account of an unreasonable increase in the demand of revenue and also the oppressive ways of its collection. Consequently, there was large scale desertion of people from Khurda between 1805 and 1817. Yet, the British went for a series of shortterm settlements, each time increasing the demands, not recognising either the productive capacity of the land or the paying capacity of the ryots. No leniency was shown even in case of natural calamities, which Odisha was frequently prone to. Rather, lands of defaulters were sold off to scheming revenue officials or speculators from Bengal. \nThe hereditary Military Commander of the deposed king, Jagabandhu Bidyadhar Mahapatra Bhramarabar Rai or Buxi Jagabandhu as he was popularly known, was one among the dispossessed land-holders. He had in effect become a beggar, and for nearly two years survived on voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda before deciding to fight for their grievances as well as his own. Over the years, what had added to these grievances were (a) the introduction of sicca rupee (silver currency) in the region, (b) the insistence on payment of revenue in the new currency, (c) an unprecedented rise in the prices of food-stuff and salt, which had become far-fetched following the introduction of salt monopoly because of which the traditional salt makers of Odisha were deprived of making salt, and (d) the auction of local estates in Calcutta, which brought in absentee landlords from Bengal to Odisha. Besides, the insensitive and corrupt police system also made the situation worse for the armed uprising to take a sinister shape. \nThe uprising was set off on 29 March 1817 as the Paiks attacked the police station and other government establishments at Banpur killing more than a hundred men and took away a large amount of government money. Soon its ripples spread in different directions with Khurda becoming its epicenter. The zamindars and ryots alike joined the Paiks with enthusiasm. Those who did not, were taken to task. A \u2018no-rent campaign\u2019 was also started. The British tried to dislodge the Paiks from their entrenched position but failed. On 14 April 1817, Buxi Jagabandhu, leading five to ten thousand Paiks and men of the Kandh tribe seized Puri and declared the hesitant king, Mukunda Dev II as their ruler. The priests of the Jagannath Temple also extended the Paiks their full support. \nSeeing the situation going out of hand, the British clamped Martial Law. The King was quickly captured and sent to prison in Cuttack with his son. The Buxi with his close associate, Krushna Chandra Bhramarabar Rai, tried to cut off all communications between Cuttack and Khurda as the uprising spread to the southern and the north-western parts of Odisha. Consequently, the British sent Major-General Martindell to clear off the area from the clutches of the Paiks while at the same time announcing rewards for the arrest of Buxi jagabandhu and his associates. In the ensuing operation hundreds of Paiks were killed, many fled to deep jungles and some returned home under a scheme of amnesty. Thus by May 1817 the uprising was mostly contained. \nHowever, outside Khurda it was sustained by Buxi Jagabandhu with the help of supporters like the Raja of Kujung and the unflinching loyalty of the Paiks until his surrender in May 1825. On their part, the British henceforth adopted a policy of \u2018leniency, indulgence and forbearance\u2019 towards the people of Khurda. The price of salt was reduced and necessary reforms were made in the police and the justice systems. Revenue officials found to be corrupt were dismissed from service and former land-holders were restored to their lands. The son of the king of Khurda, Ram Chandra Dev III was allowed to move to Puri and take charge of the affairs of the Jagannath Temple with a grant of rupees twenty-four thousand. \n In sum, it was the first such popular anti-British armed uprising in Odisha, which had far reaching effect on the future of British administration in that part of the country. To merely call it a \u2018Paik Rebellion\u2019 will thus be an understatement. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n<DOCUMENT id='3'>\nUnder the Mughals, architecture became more complex. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, and especially Shah Jahan were personally interested in literature, art and architecture. In his autobiography, Babur described his interest in planning and laying out formal gardens, placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels. \nThese gardens were called chahar bagh, four gardens, because of their symmetrical division into quarters. Beginning with Akbar, some of the most beautiful chahar baghs were constructed by Jahangir and Shah Jahan in Kashmir, Agra and Delhi (see Fig. 9). \nThere were several important architectural innovations during Akbar\u2019s reign. For inspiration, Akbar\u2019s architects turned to the tombs of his Central Asian ancestor, Timur. The central towering dome and the tall gateway (pishtaq) became important aspects of Mughal architecture, first visible in Humayun\u2019s tomb. The tomb was placed in the centre of a huge formal chahar bagh and built in the tradition known as \u201ceight paradises\u201d or hasht bihisht \u2013 a central hall surrounded by eight rooms. The building was constructed with red sandstone, edged with white marble. \nIt was during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign that the different elements of Mughal architecture were fused together in a grand harmonious synthesis. His reign witnessed a huge amount of construction activity especially in Agra and Delhi. The ceremonial halls of public and private audience (diwan-i khas o am) were carefully planned. Placed within a large courtyard, these courts were also described as chihil sutun or forty-pillared halls. \nShah Jahan\u2019s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque. The pedestal on which his throne was placed was frequently described as the qibla, the direction faced by Muslims at prayer, since everybody faced that direction when court was in session. The idea of the king as a representative of God on earth was suggested by these architectural features. \nThe connection between royal justice and the imperial court was emphasised by Shah Jahan in his newly constructed court in the Red Fort at Delhi. Behind the emperor\u2019s throne were a series of pietra dura inlays that depicted the legendary Greek god Orpheus playing the lute. It was believed that Orpheus\u2019s music could calm ferocious beasts until they coexisted together peaceably. The construction of Shah Jahan\u2019s audience hall aimed to communicate that the king\u2019s justice would treat the high and the low as equals creating a world where all could live together in harmony. \nPietra dura : Coloured, hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful, ornate patterns. \nIn the early years of his reign, Shah Jahan\u2019s capital was at Agra, a city where the nobility had constructed their homes on the banks of the river Yamuna. These were set in the midst of formal gardens constructed in the chahar bagh format. The chahar bagh garden also had a variation that historians describe as the \u201criverfront garden\u201d. In this the dwelling was not located in the middle of the chahar bagh but at its edge, close to the bank of the river. \nShah Jahan adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the Taj Mahal, the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign. Here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south. Shah Jahan develop this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river. In the new city of Shahjahanabad that he constructed in Delhi, the imperial palace commanded the river-front. Only specially favoured nobles \u2013 like his eldest son Dara Shukoh \u2013 were given access to the river. All others had to construct their homes in the city away from the River Yamuna. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: What were the primary causes that led to the Khurda Uprising of 1817, and how did the British initially suppress it and subsequently modify their policies in the region?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: The question asks for the causes, initial suppression, and subsequent policy changes related to the Khurda Uprising. I will extract these details from the 'Khurda Uprising \u2013 A Case Study' section.\n\nFirst, for the causes, the text states that Raja Mukunda Dev II was disturbed by the loss of territories and rights, leading him to negotiate with the British who later showed no inclination to oblige him (paragraph 2). Consequently, he was deposed and his territories annexed, receiving only a small grant and management rights of the Jagannath Temple (paragraph 2). Furthermore, the British policy of resuming service tenures severely affected the Paiks (ex-militia), compounded by unreasonable increases in revenue demand and oppressive collection methods (paragraph 3). Other grievances included the introduction of sicca rupee and insistence on payment in the new currency, an unprecedented rise in foodstuff and salt prices due to salt monopoly, auction of local estates to absentee landlords from Bengal, and an insensitive and corrupt police system (paragraph 4). Buxi Jagabandhu, a dispossessed land-holder, also became a key figure due to these grievances (paragraph 4).\n\nSecond, regarding the initial suppression, the text describes the uprising starting on March 29, 1817, with attacks on Banpur (paragraph 5). When the situation escalated, with Paiks seizing Puri and declaring Mukunda Dev II ruler, the British clamped Martial Law, captured the King, and sent him to prison (paragraph 6). Major-General Martindell was sent to clear the area, and rewards were announced for the arrest of Buxi Jagabandhu (paragraph 6). This operation resulted in hundreds of Paiks killed, many fleeing, and some returning under amnesty, thus mostly containing the uprising by May 1817 (paragraph 6).\n\nThird, concerning subsequent policy modifications, the text notes that after the uprising was mostly contained (though Buxi Jagabandhu sustained it until 1825), the British adopted a policy of 'leniency, indulgence and forbearance' towards the people of Khurda (paragraph 7). Specific reforms included reducing the price of salt, making necessary reforms in the police and justice systems, dismissing corrupt revenue officials, and restoring former land-holders to their lands (paragraph 7). The king's son, Ram Chandra Dev III, was also allowed to move to Puri and manage the Jagannath Temple with a grant (paragraph 7).\n\nAnswer: The primary causes of the Khurda Uprising of 1817 included the British refusal to restore lost territories and rights to Raja Mukunda Dev II after their occupation of Odisha in 1803, leading to his deposition and an unfair settlement. This was aggravated by the British policy of resuming service tenures affecting the Paiks, unreasonable increases in revenue demand, oppressive collection methods, the introduction of sicca rupee and insistence on new currency payments, unprecedented rises in foodstuff and salt prices due to a salt monopoly, the auction of local estates to absentee landlords, and a corrupt police system.\n\nInitially, the British suppressed the uprising by clamping Martial Law, capturing King Mukunda Dev II, sending Major-General Martindell to clear the area, and announcing rewards for Buxi Jagabandhu's arrest. This operation led to numerous Paik casualties, with many fleeing or returning under amnesty, largely containing the uprising by May 1817.\n\nSubsequently, the British adopted a policy of 'leniency, indulgence and forbearance' towards the people of Khurda. They reduced the price of salt, reformed the police and justice systems, dismissed corrupt revenue officials, restored former land-holders, and allowed the king's son, Ram Chandra Dev III, to manage the Jagannath Temple with a grant."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["7.5.5", "7.5.6", "8.5.5", "8.5.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}

The amount deposited can be claimed in another place by presenting the record of the deposit. \nHowever, Surat began to decline towards the end of the seventeenth century.

The British must quit India immediately, he told them. To the people he said, \u201cdo or die\u201d in your effort to fight the British \u2013 but you must fight non-violently. Gandhiji and other leaders were jailed at once but the movement spread. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join it. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In many areas the people set up their own governments. \nThe first response of the British was severe repression. By the end of 1943 over 90,000 people were arrested, and around 1,000 killed in police firing. In many areas orders were given to machine-gun crowds from airplanes. The rebellion, however, ultimately brought the Raj to its knees. \nTowards Independence and Partition \n Meanwhile, in 1940 the Muslim League had moved a resolution demanding \u201cIndependent States\u201d for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan. Why did the League ask for an autonomous arrangement for the Muslims of the subcontinent? \nFrom the late 1930s, the League began viewing the Muslims as a separate \u201cnation\u201d from the Hindus. In developing this notion it may have been influenced by the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 seemed to have convinced the League that Muslims were a minority, and they would always have to play second fiddle in any democratic structure. It feared that Muslims may even go unrepresented. The Congress\u2019s rejection of the League\u2019s desire to form a joint Congress-League government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \nThe Congress\u2019s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1930s allowed the League to widen its social support. It sought to enlarge its support in the early 1940s when most Congress leaders were in jail. At the end of the war in 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks failed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India\u2019s Muslims. The Congress could not accept this claim since a large number of Muslims still supported it. \nElections to the provinces were again held in 1946. The Congress did well in the \u201cGeneral\u201d constituencies but the League\u2019s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. It persisted with its demand for \u201cPakistan\u201d. In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. But it could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal. Partition now became more or less inevitable. \nAfter the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand. It announced 16 August 1946 as \u201cDirect Action Day\u201d. On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people. By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India. \nMany hundred thousand people were killed and numerous women had to face untold brutalities during the Partition. Millions of people were forced to flee their homes. Torn asunder from their homelands, they were reduced to being refugees in alien lands. Partition also meant that India changed, many of its cities changed, and a new country \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 was born. So, the joy of our country\u2019s independence from British rule came mixed with the pain and violence of Partition. \n\n</DOCUMENT>\n\n\n\nQuestion: Based on the provided text, what were the primary reasons for the Muslim League's demand for an autonomous arrangement for Muslims, how did their political standing shift by 1946, and what role did the British Cabinet Mission play in the eventual path to Partition?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chain of Thought: 1. The text states that the Muslim League moved a resolution in 1940 demanding 'Independent States' for Muslims. \n2. It explains the reasons for this demand: the League began viewing Muslims as a separate 'nation' from Hindus, influenced by historical tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups. \n3. More importantly, the provincial elections of 1937 convinced the League that Muslims were a minority who would always play second fiddle and might even go unrepresented in a democratic structure. \n4. The Congress's rejection of the League's desire to form a joint government in the United Provinces in 1937 also annoyed the League. \n5. The League's political standing shifted significantly by 1946, as the provincial elections held that year showed that while the Congress did well in 'General' constituencies, the League's success in the seats reserved for Muslims was 'spectacular'. This success led them to persist with their demand for 'Pakistan'.\n6. In March 1946, the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi (the Cabinet Mission) to examine this demand and suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. \n7. The mission suggested that India should remain united as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. \n8. However, the mission 'could not get the Congress and the Muslim League to agree to specific details of the proposal', leading to the conclusion that 'Partition now became more or less inevitable'.\n\nAnswer: The primary reasons for the Muslim League's demand for an autonomous arrangement for Muslims stemmed from their view of Muslims as a separate 'nation' from Hindus, influenced by historical tensions and the fear, after the 1937 provincial elections, that Muslims as a minority would always be secondary and potentially unrepresented in a democratic structure. The Congress's rejection of a joint government in 1937 further annoyed the League. By 1946, the League's political standing shifted dramatically due to their spectacular success in the provincial elections for seats reserved for Muslims. The British Cabinet Mission, sent in March 1946, proposed a united India as a loose confederation with autonomy for Muslim-majority areas, but its failure to secure agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League on the proposal's details made Partition more or less inevitable."}], "metadata": {"oracle_ids": ["8.9.7", "7.6.9", "6.11.1", "6.12.5", "6.5.6"], "num_distractors": 0}}
